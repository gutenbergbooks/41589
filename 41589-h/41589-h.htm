<small>SHADOWS CAST BEFORE</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert Culverin's</span> <i>Study at Wyvern Court.
It is a rainy Saturday morning in February.</i>
Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>is at his writing-table, as</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>enters with a deprecatory air</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> So <em>here</em> you are, Rupert! Not
<em>very</em> busy, are you? I won't keep you a moment.
(<i>She goes to a window.</i>) Such a nuisance it's turning
out wet, with all these people in the house, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Well, I was thinking that, as there's
nothing doing out of doors, I might get a chance to
knock off some of these confounded accounts, but&mdash;(<i>resignedly</i>)&mdash;if
you think I ought to go and look
after&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> No, no; the men are playing
billiards, and the women are in the morning-room&mdash;<em>they</em>'re
all right. I only wanted to ask you about
to-night. You know the Lullingtons, and the dear
Bishop and Mrs. Rodney, and one or two other
people are coming to dinner? Well, who ought to
take in Rohesia?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>in dismay</i>). Rohesia! No idea she
was coming down this week!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Yes, by the 4.45. With dear Maisie.
Surely you knew that?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> In a sort of way; didn't realize it was
so near, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> It's some time since we had her
last. And she wanted to come. I didn't think you
would like me to write and put her off.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Put her off? Of course I shouldn't,
Albinia. If my only sister isn't welcome at Wyvern
at any time&mdash;I say at <em>any</em> time&mdash;where the deuce is
she welcome?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I don't know, dear Rupert. But&mdash;but
about the table?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> So long as you don't put her near
me&mdash;that's all <em>I</em> care about.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I mean&mdash;ought I to send her in
with Lord Lullington, or the Bishop?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Why not let 'em toss up? Loser gets
her, of course.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> <em>Rupert!</em> As if I could suggest
such a thing to the Bishop! I suppose she'd better
go in with Lord Lullington&mdash;he's Lord Lieutenant&mdash;and
then it won't matter if she <em>does</em> advocate Disestablishment.
Oh, but I forgot; she thinks the
House of Lords ought to be abolished <em>too</em>!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Whoever takes Rohesia in is likely
to have a time of it. Talked poor Cantire into his
tomb a good ten years before he was due there.
Always lecturing, and domineering, and laying down
the law, as long as <em>I</em> can remember her. Can't
stand Rohesia&mdash;never could!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I don't think you ought to say
so, really, Rupert. And I'm sure <em>I</em> get on very well
with her&mdash;generally.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Because you knock under to her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I'm sure I don't, Rupert&mdash;at least,
no more than everybody else. Dear Rohesia is
so strong-minded and advanced and all that, she
takes such an interest in all the new movements
and things, that she can't understand contradiction;
she is so democratic in her ideas, don't you
know.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Didn't prevent her marrying Cantire.
And a democratic Countess&mdash;it's downright unnatural!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> She believes it's her duty to set
an example and meet the People half-way. That
reminds me&mdash;did I tell you Mr. Clarion Blair is
coming down this evening, too?&mdash;only till Monday,
Rupert.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Clarion Blair! never heard of him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I suppose I forgot. Clarion Blair
isn't his <em>real</em> name, though; it's only a&mdash;an alias.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Don't see what any fellow wants with
an alias. What <em>is</em> his real name?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Well, I know it was <em>something</em>
ending in "ell," but I mislaid his letter. Still,
Clarion Blair is the name he writes under; he's a
poet, Rupert, and quite celebrated, so I'm told.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>uneasily</i>). A poet! What on earth
possessed you to ask a literary fellow down <em>here</em>?
Poetry isn't much in our way; and a poet <em>will</em> be,
confoundedly!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/p5.jpg" width="459" height="600" alt="&quot;WHAT ON EARTH POSSESSED YOU TO ASK A LITERARY FELLOW DOWN HERE?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;WHAT ON EARTH POSSESSED YOU TO ASK A LITERARY FELLOW DOWN HERE?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I really couldn't help it, Rupert.
Rohesia insisted on my having him to meet her.
She likes meeting clever and interesting people.
And this Mr. Blair, it seems, has just written a
volume of verses which are finer than anything that's
been done since&mdash;well, for <em>ages</em>!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> What sort of verses?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Well, they're charmingly bound.
I've got the book in the house, somewhere. Rohesia
told me to send for it; but I haven't had time to
read it yet.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Shouldn't be surprised if Rohesia
hadn't, either.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> At all events, she's heard it talked
about. The young man's verses have made quite a
sensation; they're so dreadfully clever and revolutionary,
and morbid and pessimistic, and all that, so
she made me promise to ask him down here to meet
her!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Devilish thoughtful of her.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Wasn't it? She thought it might
be a valuable experience for him; he's sprung, I
believe, from <em>quite</em> the middle-class.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Don't see myself why he should be
sprung on <em>us</em>. Why can't Rohesia ask him to one of
her own places?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I dare say she will, if he turns out
to be quite presentable. And, of course, he <em>may</em>,
Rupert, for anything we can tell.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Then you've never seen him yourself!
How did you manage to ask him here, then?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Oh, I wrote to him through his
publishers. Rohesia says that's the usual way with
literary persons one doesn't happen to have met.
And he wrote to say he would come.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> So we're to have a morbid revolutionary
poet staying in the house, are we? He'll come down
to dinner in a flannel shirt and no tie&mdash;or else a <em>red</em>
one&mdash;if he don't bring down a beastly bomb and try
to blow us all up! You'll find you've made a
mistake, Albinia, depend upon it.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Dear Rupert, aren't you just a
little bit <em>narrow</em>? You forget that nowadays the
very best houses are proud to entertain Genius&mdash;no
matter <em>what</em> their opinions and appearance may be.
And besides, we don't know what changes may be
coming. Surely it is wise and prudent to conciliate
the clever young men who might inflame the masses
against us. Rohesia thinks so; she says it may be
our only chance of stemming the rising tide of
Revolution, Rupert!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Oh, if Rohesia thinks a revolution
can be stemmed by asking a few poets down from
Saturday to Monday, she might do <em>her</em> share of the
stemming at all events.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> But you will be <em>nice</em> to him,
Rupert, won't you?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> I don't know that I'm in the habit
of being uncivil to any guest of yours in this house,
my dear, but I'll be hanged if I <em>grovel</em> to him, you
know; the tide ain't as high as all that. But it's
an infernal nuisance, 'pon my word it is; you must
look after him yourself. <em>I</em> can't. I don't know what
to talk to geniuses about; I've forgotten all the
poetry I ever learnt. And if he comes out with
any of his Red Republican theories in <em>my</em> hearing,
why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Oh, but he <em>won't</em>, dear. I'm
certain he'll be quite mild and inoffensive. Look
at Shakespeare&mdash;the bust, I mean&mdash;and <em>he</em> began as
a poacher!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Ah, and this chap would put down
the Game Laws if he could, I dare say; do away with
everything that makes the country worth living in.
Why, if he had his way, Albinia, there wouldn't
be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I know, dear, I know. And you
must make him see all that from <em>your</em> point. Look,
the weather really seems to be clearing a little. We
might all of us get out for a drive or something after
lunch. I would ride, if Deerfoot's all right again;
he's the only horse I ever feel <em>really</em> safe upon, now.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Sorry, my dear, but you'll have to
drive then. Adams tells me the horse is as lame as
ever this morning, and he don't know what to make
of it. He suggested having Horsfall over, but I've
no faith in the local vets myself, so I wired to town
for old Spavin. He's seen Deerfoot before, and we
could put him up for a night or two. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>,
<i>the butler, who enters with a telegram</i>.) Eh, for me?
just wait, will you, in case there's an answer. (<i>As
he opens it.</i>) Ah, this <em>is</em> from Spavin&mdash;h'm, nuisance!
"Regret unable to leave at present, bronchitis, junior
partner could attend immediately if required.&mdash;Spavin."
Never knew he <em>had</em> a partner.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> I did hear, Sir Rupert, as Mr. Spavin
was looking out for one quite recent, being hasthmatical,
m'lady, and so I suppose this is him as the
telegram alludes to.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Very likely. Well, he's sure to be
a competent man. We'd better have him, eh,
Albinia?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Oh yes, and he must stay till
Deerfoot's better. I'll speak to Pomfret about having
a room ready in the East Wing for him. Tell him
to come by the 4.45, Rupert. We shall be sending
the omnibus in to meet that.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> All right, I've told him. (<i>Giving the
form to</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>.) See that that's sent off at once,
please. (<i>After</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> <i>has left</i>.) By the way,
Albinia, Rohesia may kick up a row if she has to
come up in the omnibus with a vet, eh?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Goodness, so she might! but he
needn't go <em>inside</em>. Still, if it goes on raining like
this&mdash;I'll tell Thomas to order a fly for him at the
station, and then there <em>can't</em> be any bother about it.</p>

<small>SELECT PASSAGES FROM A COMING POET</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Morning Room at Wyvern.</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda
Cokayne</span>, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Brooke-Chatteris</span>, <i>and</i> Miss
<span class="smcap">Vivien Spelwane</span> <i>are comfortably established
near the fireplace. The</i> <span class="smcap">Hon. Bertie Pilliner</span>,
Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Archie Bearpark</span>,
<i>have just drifted in</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Why, you <em>don't</em> mean to say you've
torn yourselves away from your beloved billiards
already? <em>Quite</em> wonderful!</p>

<p><i>Bertie Pilliner.</i> It's too <em>horrid</em> of you to leave us
to play all by ourselves! We've all got so cross
and fractious we've come in here to be petted!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He arranges himself at her feet, so as to exhibit
a very neat pair of silk socks and pumps.</i></p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Do hate to see a
fellow come down in the mornin' with evenin' shoes
on!</p>

<p><i>Archie Bearpark</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Bertie Pilliner</span>). You
speak for yourself, Pilliner. <em>I</em> didn't come to be
petted. Came to see if Lady Rhoda wouldn't come
and toboggan down the big staircase on a tea-tray.
<em>Do!</em> It's clinkin' sport!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If there's one
thing I <em>can't</em> stand, it's a rowdy bullyraggin' ass like
Archie!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda Cokayne.</i> Ta muchly, dear boy, but
you don't catch me travellin' downstairs on a tea-tray
<em>twice</em>&mdash;it's just a bit <em>too</em> clinkin', don't you
know!</p>

<p><i>Archie Bearpark</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Why, there's a
mat at the bottom of the stairs! Well, if you won't,
let's get up a cushion fight, then. Bertie and I will
choose sides. Pilliner, I'll toss you for first pick up&mdash;come
out of that, do.</p>

<p><i>Bertie Pilliner</i> (<i>lazily</i>). Thanks, I'm much too
comfy where I am. And I don't see any point in
romping and rumpling one's hair just before lunch.</p>

<p><i>Archie Bearpark.</i> Well, you <em>are</em> slack. And there's
a good hour still before lunch. Thicknesse, <em>you</em>
suggest something, there's a dear old chap.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>after a mental effort</i>). Suppose
we all go and have another look round at the gees&mdash;eh,
what?</p>

<p><i>Bertie Pilliner.</i> I beg to oppose. Do let's show
<em>some</em> respect for the privacy of the British hunter.
Why should I go and smack them on their fat backs,
and feel every one of their horrid legs twice in one
morning? I shouldn't like a horse coming into my

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Poor little fellow? On <em>my</em> lap!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Oh, it&mdash;ah&mdash;didn't occur to
me that he was on <em>your</em> lap. He don't seem to mind
<em>that</em>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> No? <em>How</em> forbearing of him!
Would you mind not standing quite so much in
my light? I can't see my work.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself, retreating</i>). That
girl's always fishin' for compliments. I didn't rise
<em>that</em> time, though. It's precious slow here. I've
a good mind to say I must get back to Aldershot

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> So <em>glad</em> you all contrive to keep
your spirits up, in spite of this dismal weather.
What is it that's amusing you all so much, eh, dear
Vivien?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Bertie Pilliner has been reading
aloud to us, dear Lady Culverin&mdash;<em>the</em> most ridiculous
poetry&mdash;made us all simply shriek. What's the
name of it? (<i>Taking the volume out of</i> <span class="smcap">Bertie's</span>
<i>hand</i>.) Oh, <i>Andromeda, and other Poems</i>. By
Clarion Blair.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>coldly</i>). Bertie Pilliner can turn
everything into ridicule, we all know; but probably
you are not aware that these particular poems are
considered quite wonderful by all competent judges.
Indeed, my sister-in-law&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>All</i> (<i>in consternation</i>). Lady Cantire! Is <em>she</em> the
author? Oh, of course, if we'd had any idea&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I've no reason to believe that Lady
Cantire ever composed <em>any</em> poetry. I was only
going to say that she was most interested in the
author, and as she and my niece Maisie are coming
to us this evening&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Dear Lady Culverin, the verses are
quite, <em>quite</em> beautiful; it was only the way they
were read.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I am glad to hear you say so, my
dear, because I'm also expecting the pleasure of
seeing the author here, and you will probably be
his neighbour to-night. I hope, Bertie, that you
will remember that this young man is a very distinguished
genius; there is no wit that <em>I</em> can discover
in making fun of what one doesn't happen to
understand.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She passes on.</i></p>

<p><i>Bertie</i> (<i>plaintively, after</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>has left

up? I'm pulverised! But really, you know, a real
live poet at Wyvern! I say, Miss Spelwane, how
will you like to have him dabbling his matted head
next to you at dinner, eh?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Perhaps I shall find a matted head
more entertaining than a smooth one. And, if you've
quite done with that volume, <em>I</em> should like to have a
look at it.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She retires with it to her room.</i></p>

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm not half sorry this Poet-johnny's
comin'; I never caught a Bard in a booby-trap
<em>yet</em>.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She's coming&mdash;this
very evenin'! And I was nearly sayin' I must
get back to Aldershot!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> So Lady Cantire's comin'; we shall
all have to be on our hind legs now! But Maisie's
a dear thing. Do you know her, Captain Thicknesse?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> I&mdash;I used to meet Lady Maisie
Mull pretty often at one time; don't know if she'll
remember it, though.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> She'll love meetin' this writin' man&mdash;she's
so fearfully romantic. I heard her say once
that she'd give anythin' to be idealized by a great
poet&mdash;sort of&mdash;what's their names&mdash;Petrarch and
Beatrice business, don't you know. It will be
rather amusin' to see whether it comes off&mdash;won't it?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>choking</i>). I&mdash;ah&mdash;no affair of
mine, really. (<i>To himself.</i>) I'm not intellectual
enough for her, I know that. Suppose I shall have
to stand by and look on at the Petrarchin'. Well,
there's always Aldershot!</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III" id="PART_III"></a>PART III<br />

<small>THE TWO ANDROMEDAS</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>Opposite a Railway Bookstall at a London Terminus.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday</i>, 4.25 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Drysdale</i> (<i>to his friend</i>, <span class="smcap">Galfrid Undershell</span>,
<i>whom he is "seeing off"</i>). Twenty minutes to spare;
time enough to lay in any quantity of light literature.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>in a head voice</i>). I fear the merely
ephemeral does not appeal to me. But I should
like to make a little experiment. (<i>To the</i> Bookstall
Clerk.) A&mdash;do you happen to have a copy left of
Clarion Blair's <i>Andromeda</i>?</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Not in stock, sir. Never 'eard of the book,
but dare say I could get it for you. Here's a
Detective Story we're sellin' like 'ot cakes&mdash;<i>The
Man with the Missing Toe</i>&mdash;very cleverly written
story, sir.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="&quot;HERE&#39;S A DETECTIVE STORY WE&#39;RE SELLING LIKE &#39;OT CAKES.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HERE&#39;S A DETECTIVE STORY WE&#39;RE SELLING LIKE &#39;OT CAKES.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I merely wished to know&mdash;that was
all. (<i>Turning with resigned disgust to</i> <span class="smcap">Drysdale</span>.)
Just think of it, my dear fellow. At a bookstall
like this one feels the pulse, as it were, of Contemporary
Culture; and here my <i>Andromeda</i>, which no
less an authority than the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> hailed as
the uprising of a new and splendid era in English
Song-making, a Poetic Renascence, my poor <i>Andromeda</i>,
is trampled underfoot by&mdash;(<i>choking</i>)&mdash;Men
with Missing Toes! What a satire on our so-called
Progress!</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> That a purblind public should prefer a
Shilling Shocker for railway reading when for a
modest half-guinea they might obtain a numbered
volume of Coming Poetry on hand-made paper! It
<em>does</em> seem incredible,&mdash;but they do. Well, if they
can't read <i>Andromeda</i> on the journey, they can at
least peruse a stinger on it in this week's <i>Saturday</i>.
Seen it?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> No. I don't vex my soul by reading
criticisms on my work. I am no Keats. They may
howl&mdash;but they will not kill <em>me</em>. By the way, the
<i>Speaker</i> had a most enthusiastic notice last week.</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> So you saw <em>that</em> then? But you're
right not to mind the others. When a fellow's
contrived to hang on to the Chariot of Fame, he
can't wonder if a few rude and envious beggars call
out "Whip behind!" eh? You don't want to get
in yet? Suppose we take a turn up to the end of
the platform.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>They do.</i></p>

<blockquote><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">James Spurrell</span>, M.R.C.V.S., <i>enters with his friend</i>,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Tanrake</span>, <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Hurdell and Tanrake</span>,
<i>Job and Riding Masters, Mayfair</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Yes, it's lucky for me old Spavin being
laid up like this&mdash;gives me a regular little outing,
do you see? going down to a swell place like this
Wyvern Court, and being put up there for a day or
two! I shouldn't wonder if they do you very well
in the housekeeper's room. (<i>To</i> Clerk.) Give me a
Pink Un and last week's <i>Dog Fancier's Guide</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> We've returned the unsold copies, sir.
Could give you <em>this</em> week's; or there's <i>The Rabbit
and Poultry Breeder's Journal</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh, rabbits be blowed! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Tanrake</span>.)
I wanted you to see that notice they put in of
Andromeda and me, with my photo and all; it said
she was the best bull-bitch they'd seen for many a
day, and fully deserved her first prize.</p>

<p><i>Tanrake.</i> She's a rare good bitch, and no mistake.
But what made you call her such an outlandish name?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, I <em>was</em> going to call her Sal; but
a chap at the College thought the other would
look more stylish if I ever meant to exhibit her.
Andromeda was one of them Roman goddesses, you
know.</p>

<p><i>Tanrake.</i> Oh, I knew <em>that</em> right enough. Come
and have a drink before you start&mdash;just for luck&mdash;not
that you want <em>that</em>.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I'm lucky enough in most things, Tom;
in everything except love. I told you about that
girl, you know&mdash;Emma&mdash;and my being as good as
engaged to her, and then, all of a sudden, she went
off abroad, and I've never seen or had a line from
her since. Can't call <em>that</em> luck, you know. Well,
I won't say no to a glass of something.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to</i> Footman). Get a compartment
for us, and two foot-warmers, and a second-class as
near ours as you can for Phillipson; then come back
here. Stay, I'd better give you Phillipson's ticket.
(<i>The</i> Footman <i>disappears in the crowd</i>.) Now we
must get something to read on the journey. (<i>To</i>
Clerk.) I want a book of some sort&mdash;no rubbish,
mind; something serious and improving, and <em>not</em>
a work of fiction.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Exactly so, ma'am. Let me see. Ah,
here's <i>Alone with the 'Airy Ainoo</i>. How would you
like that?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>with decision</i>). I should not like it
at all.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> I quite understand. Well, I can give you
<i>Three 'Undred Ways of Dressing the Cold Mutton</i>&mdash;useful
little book for a family, redooced to one and
ninepence.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Thank you. I think I will wait
till I am reduced to one and ninepence.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> Precisely. What do you say to <i>Seven
'Undred Side-splitters for Sixpence</i>? 'Ighly yumerous,
I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Are these times to split our sides,
with so many serious social problems pressing for
solution? You are presumably not without intelligence;
do you never reflect upon the responsibility
you incur in assisting to circulate trivial and frivolous
trash of this sort?</p>

<p><i>Clerk</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Well, I can't say as I do,
particular, ma'am. I'm paid to sell the books&mdash;I
don't <em>select</em> 'em.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> That is <em>no</em> excuse for you&mdash;you ought
to exercise some discrimination on your own account,
instead of pressing people to buy what can do them no
possible good. You can give me a <i>Society Snippets</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Mamma! A penny paper that says
such rude things about the Royal Family!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> It's always instructive to know
what these creatures are saying about one, my dear,
and it's astonishing how they manage to find out the
things they do. Ah, here's Gravener coming back.
He's got us a carriage, and we'd better get in.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She and her daughter enter a first-class compartment</i>;

<i>return</i>.</p>

<p><i>Drysdale</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). Well, I don't see
now where the insolence comes in. These people
have invited you to stay with them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> But why? Not because they appreciate
my work&mdash;which they probably only half
understand&mdash;but out of mere idle curiosity to see
what manner of strange beast a Poet may be! And
<em>I</em> don't know this Lady Culverin&mdash;never met her
in my life! What the deuce does she mean by
sending me an invitation? Why should these smart
women suppose that they are entitled to send for a
Man of Genius, as if he was their <em>lackey</em>? Answer
me that!</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> Perhaps the delusion is encouraged by
the fact that Genius occasionally condescends to
answer the bell.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>reddening</i>). Do you imagine I am going
down to this place simply to please <em>them</em>?</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> I should think it a doubtful kindness,
in your present frame of mind; and, as you are
hardly going to please yourself, wouldn't it be more
dignified, on the whole, not to go at all?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You never <em>did</em> understand me! Sometimes
I think I was born to be misunderstood! But
you might do me the justice to believe that I am
not going from merely snobbish motives. May I
not feel that such a recognition as this is a tribute
less to my poor self than to Literature, and that, as
such, I have scarcely the <em>right</em> to decline it?</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> Ah, if you put it in that way, I am
silenced, of course.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Or what if I am going to show these
Patricians that&mdash;Poet of the People as I am&mdash;they
can neither patronise nor cajole me?</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> Exactly, old chap&mdash;what if you <em>are</em>?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I don't say that I may not have
another reason&mdash;a&mdash;a rather romantic one&mdash;but you
would only sneer if I told you! I know you think
me a poor creature whose head has been turned by
an undeserved success.</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> You're not going to try to pick a quarrel
with an old chum, are you? Come, you know well
enough I don't think anything of the sort. I've
always said you had the right stuff in you, and
would show it some day; there are even signs of it
in <i>Andromeda</i> here and there; but you'll do better
things than that, if you'll only let some of the wind
out of your head. I take an interest in you, old
fellow, and that's just why it riles me to see you
taking yourself so devilish seriously on the strength
of a little volume of verse which&mdash;between you and
me&mdash;has been "boomed" for all it's worth, and considerably
more. You've only got your immortality
on a short repairing lease at present, old boy!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with bitterness</i>). I am fortunate in
possessing such a candid friend. But I mustn't keep
you here any longer.</p>

<p><i>Drysdale.</i> Very well. I suppose you're going first?
Consider the feelings of the Culverin footman at the
other end!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>as he fingers a first-class ticket in his
pocket</i>). You have a very low view of human nature!
(<i>Here he becomes aware of a remarkably pretty face at
a second-class window close by</i>). As it <em>happens</em>, I am
travelling second.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He gets in.</i></p>

<p><i>Drysdale</i> (<i>at the window</i>). Well, good-bye, old chap.
Good luck to you at Wyvern, and remember&mdash;wear

<small>RUSHING TO CONCLUSIONS</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In a First-class Compartment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Formidable old party opposite
me in the furs! Nice-looking girl over in the
corner; not a patch on my Emma, though! Wonder
why I catch 'em sampling me over their papers
whenever I look up! Can't be anything wrong
with my turn out. Why, of course, they heard Tom
talk about my going down to Wyvern Court; think
I'm a visitor there and no end of a duke! Well,
what snobs some people are, to be sure!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to herself</i>). So this is the young
poet I made Albinia ask to meet me. I can't be
mistaken, I distinctly heard his friend mention
<i>Andromeda</i>. H'm, well, it's a comfort to find he's
<em>clean</em>! Have I read his poetry or not? I know I
<em>had</em> the book, because I distinctly remember telling
Maisie she wasn't to read it&mdash;but&mdash;well, that's of no
consequence. He looks clever and quite respectable&mdash;not
in the least picturesque&mdash;which is fortunate.
I was beginning to doubt whether it was quite
prudent to bring Maisie; but I needn't have worried
myself.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Here, actually in the
same carriage! Does he guess who <em>I</em> am? Somehow&mdash;&mdash;
Well, he certainly <em>is</em> different from what
I expected. I thought he would show more signs
of having thought and suffered; for he <em>must</em> have
suffered to write as he does. If mamma knew I had
read his poems; that I had actually written to beg
him not to refuse Aunt Albinia's invitation! He
never wrote back. Of course I didn't put any
address; but still, he could have found out from the
Red Book if he'd cared. I'm rather glad now he
<em>didn't</em> care.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Old girl seems as if she
meant to be sociable; better give her an opening.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Hem! would you like the window down
an inch or two?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Not on <em>my</em> account, thank you.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Broke the ice, anyway.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, <em>I</em> don't want it down, but some people
have such a mania for fresh air.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>with a dignified little shiver</i>). Have
they? With a temperature as glacial as it is in
here! They must be maniacs indeed!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, it <em>is</em> chilly; been raw all day.
(<i>To himself.</i>) She don't answer. I <em>haven't</em> broken
the ice.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He produces a memorandum book.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He hasn't said anything
<em>very</em> original yet. So <em>nice</em> of him not to pose! Oh,
he's got a note-book; he's going to compose a poem.
How interesting!</p>

</div>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Yes, I'm all right if Heliograph
wins the Lincolnshire Handicap; lucky to get
on at the price I did. Wonder what's the latest
about the City and Suburban? Let's see whether
the Pink Un has anything about it.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He refers to the Sporting Times.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). The inspiration's stopped&mdash;<em>what</em>
a pity! How odd of him to read the <i>Globe</i>!
I thought he was a Democrat!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Maisie, there's quite a clever little
notice in <i>Society Snippets</i> about the dance at
Skympings last week. I'm sure I wonder how
they pick up these things; it quite bears out
what I was told; says the supper arrangements
were "simply disgraceful; not nearly enough
champagne; and what there was, undrinkable!"
So <em>like</em> poor dear Lady Chesepare; never <em>does</em> do
things like anybody else. I'm sure <em>I've</em> given her
hints enough!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, with a suppressed grin</i>).
Wants to let me see <em>she</em> knows some swells. Now
<em>ain't</em> that paltry?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>tendering the paper</i>). Would you
like to see it, Maisie? Just this bit here; where
my finger is.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, flushing</i>). I saw him
smile. What <em>must</em> he think of us, with his splendid
scorn for rank? (<i>Aloud.</i>) No, thank you, mamma:
such a wretched light to read by!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Chance for <em>me</em> to cut in!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Beastly light, isn't it? 'Pon my word,
the company ought to provide us with a dog and
string apiece when we get out!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>bringing a pair of long-handled
glasses to bear upon him</i>). I happen to hold shares
in this line. May I ask <em>why</em> you consider a provision
of dogs and string at all the stations a necessary
or desirable expenditure?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh&mdash;er&mdash;well, you know, I only meant,
bring on <em>blindness</em> and that. Harmless attempt at a
joke, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I see. I scarcely expected that <em>you</em>
would condescend to such weakness. I&mdash;ah&mdash;think
you are going down to stay at Wyvern for a few
days, are you not?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I was right. What Tom
said <em>did</em> fetch the old girl; no harm in humouring
her a bit. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes&mdash;oh yes, they&mdash;aw&mdash;wanted
me to run down when I could.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I heard they were expecting you. You
will find Wyvern a pleasant house&mdash;for a short visit.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <em>She</em> heard! Oh, she wants
to kid me she knows the Culverins. Rats! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Shall I, though? I dare say.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Lady Culverin is a very sweet
woman; a little limited, perhaps, not intellectual, or
quite what one would call the <i>grande dame</i>; but
perhaps <em>that</em> could scarcely be expected.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>vaguely</i>). Oh, of course not&mdash;no. (<i>To
himself.</i>) If she bluffs, so can I! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It's
funny your turning out to be an acquaintance of
Lady C.'s, though.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> You think so? But I should
hardly call myself an <em>acquaintance</em>.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Old cat's trying to back out
of it now; she shan't, though! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, then
I suppose you know Sir Rupert best?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Yes, I certainly know Sir Rupert
better.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Oh, you do, do you? We'll
see. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Nice cheery old chap, Sir Rupert,
isn't he? I must tell him I travelled down in the
same carriage with a particular friend of his. (<i>To
himself.</i>) That'll make her sit up!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Oh, then you and my brother
Rupert have met already?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>aghast</i>). Your brother! Sir Rupert Culverin
your&mdash;&mdash;! Excuse me&mdash;if I'd only known, I&mdash;I
do assure you I never should have dreamt of
saying&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>graciously</i>). You've said nothing
whatever to distress yourself about. You couldn't
possibly be expected to know who I was. Perhaps
I had better tell you at once that I am Lady Cantire,
and this is my daughter, Lady Maisie Mull. (<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>
<i>returns</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie's</span> <i>little bow in the deepest
confusion</i>.) We are going down to Wyvern too,
so I hope we shall very soon become better acquainted.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, overwhelmed</i>). The deuce we
shall! I <em>have</em> got myself into a hole this time; I
wish I could see my way well out of it! Why on
earth couldn't I hold my confounded tongue? I
<em>shall</em> look an ass when I tell 'em.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In a Second-class Compartment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Singularly attractive face
this girl has; so piquant and so refined! I can't
help fancying she is studying me under her eyelashes.
She has remarkably bright eyes. Can she
be interested in me? Does she expect me to talk to
her? There are only she and I&mdash;but no, just now I
would rather be alone with my thoughts. This
Maisie Mull whom I shall meet so soon; what is
<em>she</em> like, I wonder? I presume she is unmarried.
If I may judge from her artless little letter, she is
young and enthusiastic, and she is a passionate
admirer of my verse; she is longing to meet me.
I suppose some men's vanity would be flattered by
a tribute like that. I think I must have none; for
it leaves me strangely cold. I did not even reply;
it struck me that it would be difficult to do so with
any dignity, and she didn't tell me where to write
to.... After all, how do I know that this will
not end&mdash;like everything else&mdash;in disillusion? Will
not such crude girlish adoration pall upon me in
time? If she were exceptionally lovely; or say,
even as charming as this fair fellow-passenger of
mine&mdash;why then, to be sure&mdash;but no, something
warns me that that is not to be. I shall find her
plain, sandy, freckled; she will render me ridiculous
by her undiscriminating gush.... Yes, I feel my
heart sink more and more at the prospect of this
visit. Ah me!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He sighs heavily.</i></p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It's too silly to
be sitting here like a pair of images, considering
that&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) I hope you aren't feeling unwell?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Thank you, no, not unwell. I was
merely thinking.</p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger.</i> You don't seem very cheerful
over it, I must say. I've no wish to be inquisitive,
but perhaps you're feeling a little low-spirited about
the place you're going to?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I&mdash;I must confess I am rather dreading
the prospect. How wonderful that you should
have guessed it!</p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger.</i> Oh, I've been through it
myself. I'm just the same when <em>I</em> go down to a
new place; feel a sort of sinking, you know, as if
the people were sure to be disagreeable, and I should
never get on with them.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> <em>Exactly</em> my own sensations! If I
could only be sure of finding <em>one</em> kindred spirit, one
soul who would help and understand me. But I
daren't let myself hope even for that!</p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger.</i> Well, I wouldn't judge
beforehand. The chances are there'll be <em>somebody</em>
you can take to.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). What sympathy! What
bright, cheerful common sense! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Do you
know, you encourage me more than you can possibly
imagine!</p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger</i> (<i>retreating</i>). Oh, if you are
going to take my remarks like <em>that</em>, I shall be afraid
to go on talking to you!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with pathos</i>). Don't&mdash;<em>don't</em> be afraid to
talk to me! If you only knew the comfort you
give! I have found life very sad, very solitary.
And true sympathy is so rare, so refreshing. I&mdash;I
fear such an appeal from a stranger may seem a
little startling; it is true that hitherto we have
only exchanged a very few sentences; and yet
already I feel that we have something&mdash;much&mdash;in
common. You can't be so cruel as to let all
intimacy cease here&mdash;it is quite tantalising enough
that it must end so soon. A very few more minutes,
and this brief episode will be only a memory; I
shall have left the little green oasis far behind me,
and be facing the dreary desert once more&mdash;alone!</p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Well, of all the
uncomplimentary things! As it happens, though,
"the little green oasis"&mdash;as you're kind enough to
call me&mdash;<em>won't</em> be left behind; not if it's aware of
it! I think I heard your friend mention Wyvern
Court! Well, that's where <em>I'm</em> going.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). You&mdash;<em>you</em> are going to
Wyvern Court! Why, then, you must be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He checks himself.</i></p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger.</i> What were you going to
say; <em>what</em> must I be?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). There is no doubt about
it; bright, independent girl; gloves a trifle worn;
travels second-class for economy; it must be Miss
Mull herself; her letter mentioned Lady Culverin
as her aunt. A poor relation, probably. She doesn't
suspect that I am&mdash;&mdash; I won't reveal myself just
yet; better let it dawn upon her gradually. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Why, I was only about to say, why then you must
be going to the same house as I am. How extremely
fortunate a coincidence!</p>

<p><i>His Fellow Passenger.</i> That remains to be seen.
(<i>To herself.</i>) What a funny little man; such a
flowery way of talking for a footman. Oh, but I
forgot; he said he <em>wasn't</em> going to wear livery.
Well, he <em>would</em> look a sight in it!</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In a First-class Compartment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Poets don't seem to
have much self-possession. He seems perfectly
overcome by hearing my name like that. If only
he doesn't lose his head completely and say something
about my wretched letter!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'd better tell 'em before
they find out for themselves. (<i>Aloud; desperately.</i>)
My lady, I&mdash;I feel I ought to explain at once
how I come to be going down to Wyvern like
this.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>only just suppresses a terrified
protest</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>benignly amused</i>). My good sir,
there's not the slightest necessity; I am perfectly
aware of who you are, and everything about you!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>incredulously</i>). But really I don't see
<em>how</em> your ladyship&mdash;&mdash; Why, I haven't said a <em>word</em>
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>with a solemn waggishness</i>.) Celebrities
who mean to preserve their <i>incognito</i> shouldn't
allow their friends to see them off. I happened to
hear a certain <i>Andromeda</i> mentioned, and that was
quite enough for Me!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, relieved</i>). She knows; seen
the sketch of me in the <i>Dog Fancier</i>, I expect; goes
in for breeding bulls herself, very likely. Well,
that's a load off my mind! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You don't say
so, my lady. I'd no idea your ladyship would have
any taste that way; most agreeable surprise to me,
I can assure you!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I see no reason for <em>surprise</em> in the
matter. I have always endeavoured to cultivate
my taste in all directions; to keep in touch with
every modern development. I make it a rule to
read and see <em>everything</em>. Of course, I have no time
to give more than a rapid glance at most things;
but I hope some day to be able to have another
look at your <i>Andromeda</i>. I hear the most glowing
accounts from all the judges.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She knows all the judges!
She <em>must</em> be in the fancy! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Any time
your ladyship likes to name I shall be proud and
happy to bring her round for your inspection.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>with condescension</i>). If you are kind
enough to offer me a copy of <i>Andromeda</i>, I shall be
<em>most</em> pleased to possess one.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Sharp old customer, this;
trying to rush me for a pup. <em>I</em> never offered her
one! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, as to <em>that</em>, my lady, I've
promised so many already, that really I don't&mdash;but
there&mdash;I'll see what I can <em>do</em> for you. I'll make a
note of it; you mustn't mind having to <em>wait</em> a bit.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>raising her eyebrows</i>). I will make
an effort to support existence in the meantime.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I couldn't have believed
that the man who could write such lovely verses
should be so&mdash;well, not <em>exactly</em> a gentleman! How
<em>petty</em> of me to have such thoughts. Perhaps geniuses
never <em>are</em>. And as if it <em>mattered</em>! And I'm sure
he's very natural and simple, and I shall like him
when I know him better.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>The train slackens.</i></p>

Shuntingbridge. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, <i>as they get out</i>.)
Now, if you'll kindly take charge of these bags, and

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>at another part of the platform&mdash;to

Oh, there she is, pointing out her luggage. What a

poor relation. How graceful and collected she is,
and how she orders the porters about! I really
believe I shall enjoy this visit. (<i>To a porter.</i>)

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Never mind about

<p><i>Footman.</i> Everything for the Court is on top now,

Come in, and let us start.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> <em>Please</em> get in&mdash;there's <em>plenty</em> of room!</p>


<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). They <em>are</em> chummy, and no
mistake! (<i>Aloud, as he gets in.</i>) I do hope it won't
be considered any intrusion&mdash;my coming up along
with your ladyships, I mean!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>snappishly</i>). Intrusion! I never
heard such nonsense! Did you expect to be asked
to run behind? You really mustn't be so ridiculously
modest. As if your <i>Andromeda</i> hadn't procured you
the <i>entrée</i> everywhere!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>The omnibus starts.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Good old Drummy! No
idea I was such a swell. I'll keep my tail up. Shyness
ain't one of <em>my</em> failings. (<i>Aloud, to an indistinct
mass at the further end of the omnibus, which is unlighted.</i>)
Er&mdash;hum&mdash;pitch dark night, my lady,
don't get much idea of the country! (<i>The mass

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>distantly</i>). My mother gets tired
rather easily. (<i>To herself.</i>) It's really too dreadful;
he makes me hot all over! If he's going to do this
kind of thing at Wyvern! And I'm more or less
<em>responsible</em> for him, too! I <em>must</em> see if I can't&mdash;&mdash;
It will be only kind. (<i>Aloud, nervously.</i>) Mr.&mdash;Mr.
Blair!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Excuse me, my lady, not <i>Blair</i>&mdash;Spurrell.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Of course, <em>how</em> stupid of me. I knew
it wasn't <em>really</em> your name. Mr. <em>Spurrell</em>, then, you&mdash;you
won't mind if I give you just one little hint,
<em>will</em> you?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I shall take it kindly of your ladyship,
whatever it is.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>more nervously still</i>). It's really such
a trifle, but&mdash;but, in speaking to mamma or me, it
isn't at all necessary to say "my lady" or "your
ladyship." I&mdash;I mean, it sounds rather, well&mdash;<em>formal</em>,
don't you know!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <em>She's</em> going to be chummy
now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I thought, on a first acquaintance,
it was only manners.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh&mdash;manners? yes, I&mdash;I dare say&mdash;but
still&mdash;but still&mdash;<em>not</em> at Wyvern, don't you
know. If you like, you can call mamma "Lady
Cantire," and me "Lady Maisie," now and then,
and, of course, my aunt will be "Lady Culverin,"
but&mdash;but if there are other people staying in the
house, you needn't call them <em>anything</em>, do you
see?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm not likely to have the
chance! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, if you're sure they won't
<em>mind</em> it, because I'm not used to this sort of thing,
so I put myself entirely in your hands,&mdash;for, of
course, <em>you</em> know what brought me down here?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He means my foolish
letter! Oh, I must put a stop to <em>that</em> at once! (<i>In
a hurried undertone.</i>) Yes&mdash;yes; I&mdash;I think I do
I mean, I <em>do</em> know&mdash;but&mdash;but <em>please</em> forget it&mdash;<em>indeed</em>,
you must!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Forget I've come down as a
vet? The Culverins will take care I don't forget
that! (<i>Aloud.</i>) But, I say, it's all very well; but
how <em>can</em> I? Why, look here; I was told I was to
come down here on purpose to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>on thorns</i>). I know&mdash;you needn't tell
me! And <em>don't</em> speak so loud! <em>Mamma</em> might
hear!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). What if she did? Why, I
thought her la&mdash;your mother <em>knew</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He actually thinks I
should tell mamma! Oh, how <em>dense</em> he is! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;of <em>course</em> she knows&mdash;but&mdash;but you might
<em>wake</em> her! And&mdash;and please don't allude to it again&mdash;to
me or&mdash;or any one. (<i>To herself.</i>) That I should
have to beg him to be silent like this! But what
can I <em>do</em>? Goodness only knows <em>what</em> he mightn't
say, if I don't warn him!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>nettled</i>). I don't mind <em>who</em> knows. <em>I'm</em>
not ashamed of it, Lady Maisie&mdash;whatever you may
be!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, exasperated</i>). He dares to
imply that <em>I</em>'ve done something to be ashamed of!
(<i>Aloud, haughtily.</i>) I'm <em>not</em> ashamed&mdash;why <em>should</em> I
be? Only&mdash;oh, can't you <em>really</em> understand that&mdash;that
one may do things which one wouldn't care to
be reminded of publicly? I don't <em>wish</em> it&mdash;isn't <em>that</em>
enough?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I see what she's at now&mdash;doesn't
want it to come out that she's travelled down
here with a vet! (<i>Aloud, stiffly.</i>) A lady's wish is
enough for <em>me</em> at any time. If you're sorry for having
gone out of your way to be friendly, why, I'm not
the person to take advantage of it. I hope I know
how to behave.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He takes refuge in offended silence.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Why did I say anything
at all! I've only made things worse&mdash;I've let him
see that he <em>has</em> an advantage. And he's certain to
use it sooner or later&mdash;unless I am civil to him. I've
offended him now&mdash;and I shall <em>have</em> to make it up
with him!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I thought all along she
didn't seem as chummy as her mother&mdash;but to turn
round on me like this!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>waking up</i>). Well, Mr. Andromeda,
I should have thought you and my daughter might
have found <em>some</em> subject in common; but I haven't
heard a word from either of you since we left the
station.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). That's <em>some</em> comfort!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) You must have had a nap, mamma. We&mdash;we
<em>have</em> been talking.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh yes, we <em>have</em> been talking, I can
assure you, Lady Cantire!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Dear me. Well, Maisie, I hope the
conversation was entertaining?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> M&mdash;most entertaining, mamma!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I'm quite sorry I missed it. (<i>The

man, you seem to need somebody to bear you <em>in</em>!
Come, you are under <em>my</em> wing. <em>I</em> answer for your
welcome&mdash;so do as you're told.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, as he follows resignedly</i>). It's
my belief there'll be a jolly row when I <em>do</em> go in;
but it's not my fault!</p>

Lady Cantire and Lady Maisie Mull (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>.)

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>dolefully</i>). You can say "James Spurrell"&mdash;you

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>ignoring this suggestion</i>). Mr. James
Spurrell.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, on the threshold</i>). If I don't
get the chuck for this, I <em>shall</em> be surprised, that's all!</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In a Fly.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Alone with a lovely girl,
who has no suspicion, as yet, that I am the poet
whose songs have thrilled her with admiration!
<em>Could</em> any situation be more romantic? I think I
must keep up this little mystification as long as
possible.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I wonder who he is?
<em>Somebody's</em> Man, I suppose. I do believe he's struck
with me. Well, I've no objection. I don't see why
I shouldn't forget Jim now and then&mdash;he's quite
forgotten me! (<i>Aloud.</i>) They might have sent a
decent carriage for us instead of this ramshackle old
summerhouse. We shall be <em>hours</em> getting to the
house at this rate!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>gallantly</i>). For my part, I care not
how long we may be. I feel so unspeakably content
to be where I am.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>disdainfully</i>). In this mouldy, lumbering
old concern? You must be rather easily contented,
then!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>dreamily</i>). It travels only too swiftly.
To me it is a veritable enchanted car, drawn by a
magic steed.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> I don't know whether he's magic&mdash;but
I'm sure he's lame. And stuffiness is not <em>my</em> notion
of <em>enchantment</em>.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I'm not prepared to deny the stuffiness.
But cannot you guess what has transformed
this vehicle for me&mdash;in spite of its undeniable
shortcomings&mdash;or must I speak more plainly
still?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Well, considering the shortness of our
acquaintance, I must say you've spoken quite plainly
enough as it is!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I know I must seem unduly expansive,
and wanting in reserve; and yet that is not my true
disposition. In general, I feel an almost fastidious
shrinking from strangers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>with a little laugh</i>). Really? I
shouldn't have thought it!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Because, in the present case, I do not&mdash;I
cannot&mdash;feel as if we <em>were</em> strangers. Some
mysterious instinct led me, almost from the first, to
associate you with a certain Miss Maisie Mull.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Well, I wonder how you discovered
<em>that</em>. Though you shouldn't have said "Miss"&mdash;<em>Lady</em>
Maisie Mull is the proper form.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Lady Maisie Mull! I
attach no meaning to titles&mdash;and yet nothing but
rank could confer such perfect ease and distinction.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I should have said <em>Lady</em> Maisie Mull,
undoubtedly&mdash;forgive my ignorance. But at least
I have divined you. Does nothing tell you who and
what <em>I</em> may be?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Oh, I think I can give a tolerable
guess at what <em>you</em> are.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You recognize the stamp of the Muse
upon me, then?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Well, I shouldn't have taken you for
a groom exactly.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with some chagrin</i>). You are really too
flattering!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Am I? Then it's your turn now.
You might say you'd never have taken me for a
<em>lady's maid</em>!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I might&mdash;if I had any desire to make
an unnecessary and insulting remark.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Insulting? Why, it's what I <em>am</em>!
I'm maid to Lady Maisie. I thought your mysterious
instinct told you all about it?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself&mdash;after the first shock</i>). A
lady's maid! Gracious Heaven! What have I been
saying&mdash;or rather, what <em>haven't</em> I? (<i>Aloud.</i>) To&mdash;to
be sure it did. Of course, I quite understand
<em>that</em>. (<i>To himself.</i>) Oh, confound it all, I wish we
were at Wyvern!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> And, after all, you've never told me
who <em>you</em> are. Who <em>are</em> you?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I must not humiliate this
poor girl! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I? Oh&mdash;a very insignificant
person, I assure you! (<i>To himself.</i>) This is an
occasion in which deception is pardonable&mdash;even
justifiable!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Oh, I knew <em>that</em> much. But you let
out just now you had to do with a Mews. You
aren't a rough-rider, are you?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> N&mdash;not <em>exactly</em>&mdash;not a <em>rough</em>-rider.
(<i>To himself.</i>) Never on a horse in my life!&mdash;unless
I count my <i>Pegasus</i>. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But you are right
in supposing I am connected with a muse&mdash;in one
sense.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> I <em>said</em> so, didn't I? Don't you think
it was rather clever of me to spot you, when you're
not a bit horsey-looking?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with elaborate irony</i>). Accept my compliments
on a power of penetration which is simply
phenomenal!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>giving him a little push</i>). Oh, go along&mdash;it's
all talk with you&mdash;I don't believe you mean
a word you say!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She's becoming absolutely
vulgar. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I don't&mdash;I <em>don't</em>; it's a manner
I have; you mustn't attach any importance to it&mdash;none
whatever!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> What! Not to all those high-flown
compliments? Do you mean to tell me you are
only a gay deceiver, then?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>in horror</i>). Not a <em>deceiver</em>, no; and
decidedly not <em>gay</em>. I mean I <em>did</em> mean the <em>compliments</em>,
of course. (<i>To himself.</i>) I mustn't let her
suspect anything, or she'll get talking about it; it
would be too horrible if this were to get round to
Lady Maisie or the Culverins&mdash;so undignified; and
it would ruin all my <em>prestige</em>! I've only to go on
playing a part for a few minutes, and&mdash;maid or not&mdash;she's
a most engaging girl!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He goes on playing the part, with the unexpected

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>receiving</i> <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>). Lady Maisie's
maid, I presume? I'm the butler here&mdash;Mr. Tredwell.
Your ladies arrived some time back. I'll
take you to the housekeeper, who'll show you their
rooms, and where yours is, and I hope you'll find
everything comfortable. (<i>In an undertone, indicating</i>
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>who is awaiting recognition in the doorway</i>.)
Do you happen to know who it is <em>with</em> you?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>in a whisper</i>). I can't quite make him
out&mdash;he's so flighty in his talk. But he <em>says</em> he
belongs to some Mews or other.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Oh, then <em>I</em> know who he is. We expect
him right enough. He's a partner in a crack firm of
Vets. We've sent for him special. I'd better see
to him, if you don't mind finding your own way to
the housekeeper's room, second door to the left,
down that corridor. (<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> <i>departs</i>.) Good
evening to you, Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>coming forward</i>). Mr. Undershell.
Lady Culverin expects me, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Quite correct, Mr. Undershell, sir. She
do. Leastwise, I shouldn't say myself she'd require
to see you&mdash;well, not <em>before</em> to-morrow morning&mdash;but
you won't mind <em>that</em>, I dare say.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>choking</i>). Not mind that! Take me
to her at once!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Couldn't take it on myself, sir, really.
There's no particular 'urry. I'll let her ladyship
know you're 'ere; and if she wants you, she'll send
for you; but, with a party staying in the 'ouse, and
others dining with us to-night, it ain't likely as
she'll have time for you till to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Oh, then whenever her ladyship
should find leisure to recollect my existence, will
you have the goodness to inform her that I have
taken the liberty of returning to town by the next
train?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Lor! Mr. Undershell, you aren't so
pressed as all <em>that</em>, are you? I know my lady
wouldn't like you to go without seeing you personally;
no more wouldn't Sir Rupert. And I understood
you was coming down for the Sunday!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>furious</i>). So did <em>I</em>&mdash;but not to be
treated like this!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>soothingly</i>). Why, <em>you</em> know what ladies
are. And you couldn't see Deerfoot&mdash;not properly,
to-night, either.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I have seen enough of this place
already. I intend to go back by the next train, I
tell you.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> But there <em>ain't</em> any next train up to-night&mdash;being
a loop line&mdash;not to mention that I've
sent the fly away, and they can't spare no one at the
stables to drive you in. Come, sir, make the best of
it. I've had my horders to see that you're made
comfortable, and Mrs. Pomfret and me will expect
the pleasure of your company at supper in the
'ousekeeper's room, 9.30 sharp. I'll send the
steward's room boy to show you to your room.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He goes, leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>speechless</i>.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>almost foaming</i>). The insolence of
these cursed aristocrats! Lady Culverin will see
me when she has time, forsooth! I am to be entertained
in the servants' hall! <em>This</em> is how our upper
classes honour Poetry! I won't stay a single hour
under their infernal roof. I'll walk. But where
<em>to</em>? And how about my luggage?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span> <i>returns</i>.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Mr. Tredwell says you want to go
already! It <em>can't</em> be true! Without even waiting
for supper?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). Why should I wait for
supper in this house?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Well, <em>I</em> shall be there; I don't know
if <em>that's</em> any inducement.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She looks down.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She is a singularly bewitching

be an experience&mdash;a study in life. I can always go
afterwards. I <em>will</em> stay. (<i>Aloud.</i>) You little know

<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>The Amber Boudoir at Wyvern immediately after</i>
Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> <i>and her daughter have entered</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>in reply to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>). Tea?
oh yes, my dear; anything <em>warm</em>! I'm positively
perished&mdash;that tedious cold journey and the long
drive afterwards! I always tell Rupert he would
see me <em>far</em> oftener at Wyvern if he would only get
the company to bring the line round close to the
park gates, but it has <em>no</em> effect upon him! (<i>As</i>
<span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> <i>announces</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, <i>who enters in trepidation</i>.)
Mr. James Spurrell! Who's Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?
Oh, to be sure; <em>that's</em> the name of my interesting
young poet&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>, you know, my dear! Go
and be pleasant to him, Albinia, he wants reassuring.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>a trifle nervous</i>). How do you do,
Mr.&mdash;ah&mdash;Spurrell? (<i>To herself.</i>) I <em>said</em> he ended
in "ell"! (<i>Aloud.</i>) So pleased to see you! We
think so much of your <i>Andromeda</i> here, you know.
Quite delightful of you to find time to run down!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Why, <em>she's</em> chummy, too!
Old Drummy pulls me through everything! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Don't name it, my la&mdash;hum&mdash;Lady Culverin. No
trouble at all; only too proud to get your summons!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He doesn't seem very
revolutionary! (<i>Aloud.</i>) That's so sweet of you;
when so many must be absolutely fighting to get
you!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh, as for that, there <em>is</em> rather a run on
me just now, but I put everything else aside for <em>you</em>,
of course!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He's soon <em>reassured</em>.
(<i>Aloud, with a touch of frost.</i>) I am sure we must
consider ourselves most fortunate. (<i>Turning to the
Countess.</i>) You <em>did</em> say cream, Rohesia? Sugar,
Maisie dearest?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm all right up to now!
I suppose I'd better say nothing about the horse till
<em>they</em> do. I feel rather out of it among these nobs,
though. I'll try and chum on to little Lady Maisie
again; she may have got over her temper by this
time, and she's the only one I know. (<i>He approaches
her.</i>) Well, Lady Maisie, here I <em>am</em>, you see. I'd
really no idea your aunt would be so friendly! I
say, you know, you don't mind <em>speaking</em> to a fellow,
do you? I've no one else I can go to&mdash;and&mdash;and
it's a bit strange at first, you know!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>colouring with mingled apprehension,
vexation, and pity</i>). If I can be of any help to you,
Mr. Spurrell&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, if you'd only tell me what I
ought to <em>do</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Surely that's very simple; do
<em>nothing</em>; just take everything quietly as it comes,
and you <em>can't</em> make any mistakes.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). And you don't think anybody'll
see anything out of the way in my being
here like this?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I'm only too afraid they
<em>will</em>! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You really <em>must</em> have a little self-confidence.
Just remember that no one here could
produce anything a millionth part as splendid as
your <i>Andromeda</i>! It's <em>too</em> distressing to see you so
<em>appallingly</em> humble! (<i>To herself.</i>) There's Captain
Thicknesse over there&mdash;he <em>might</em> come and rescue
me; but he doesn't seem to care to!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, you <em>do</em> put some heart into me,
Lady Maisie. I feel equal to the lot of 'em now!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>). Is <em>that</em> the poet?
Why, but I say&mdash;he's a <em>fraud</em>! Where's his matted
head? He's not a bit ragged, or rusty either. And
why don't he dabble? Don't seem to know what to
do with his hands quite, though, <em>does</em> he?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>coldly</i>). He knows how to do some
very exquisite poetry with <em>one</em> of them, at all
events. I've been reading it, and <em>I</em> think it perfectly
marvellous!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> I see what it is, you're preparing to turn
his matted head for him? I warn you you'll only
waste your sweetness. That pretty little Lady
Maisie's annexed <em>him</em>. Can't you content yourself
with <em>one</em> victim at a time?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Don't be so utterly idiotic! (<i>To
herself.</i>) If Maisie imagines she's to be allowed to
monopolise the only man in the room worth talking
to!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself, as he watches</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>). She is lookin' prettier than ever! Forgotten
me. Used to be friendly enough once,
though, till her mother warned me off. Seems to
have a good deal to say to that poet fellow; saw
her colour up from here the moment he came near;
he's <em>begun</em> Petrarchin', hang him! I'd cross over
and speak to her if I could catch her eye. Don't
know, though; what's the use? She wouldn't thank
me for interruptin'. She likes these clever chaps;
don't signify to her if they <em>are</em> bounders, I suppose.
<em>I</em>'m not intellectual. Gad, I wish I'd gone back to
Aldershot!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>by the tea-table</i>). Why don't you
make that woman of yours send you up decent
cakes, my dear? These are cinders. I'm afraid
you let her have too much of her own way. Now,
tell me&mdash;who are your party? Vivien Spelwane!
Never have that girl to meet me again, I can't
<em>endure</em> her; and that affected little ape of a Mr.
Pilliner&mdash;h'm! Do I see Captain Thicknesse?
Now, I don't object to <em>him</em>. Maisie and he used
to be great friends.... Ah, how do you <em>do</em>, Captain
Thicknesse? Quite pleasant finding you here; such
ages since we saw anything of you! Why haven't
you been near us all this time? ... Oh, I may
have been out once or twice when you called; but
you might have tried again, <em>mightn't</em> you? There,
<em>I</em> forgive you; you had better go and see if you can
make your peace with Maisie!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself, as he obeys</i>). Doosid
odd, Lady Cantire comin' round like this. Wish
she'd thought of it before.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>in a whisper</i>). He's always been
such a favourite of mine. They tell me his uncle,
poor dear Lord Dunderhead, is <em>so</em> ill&mdash;felt the loss of
his only son so terribly. Of course it will make a
great difference&mdash;in many ways.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>constrainedly to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>).
How do you do? Afraid you've forgotten me.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh no, indeed! (<i>Hurriedly.</i>) You&mdash;you
don't know Mr. Spurrell, I think? (<i>Introducing
them.</i>) Captain Thicknesse.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> How are you? Been hearin'
a lot about you lately. <i>Andromeda</i>, don't you know;
and that kind of thing.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> It's wonderful what a hit she seems to
have made&mdash;not that I'm <em>surprised</em> at it, either; I
always knew&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Oh, Mr. Spurrell, you
haven't had any tea! <em>Do</em> go and get some before it's
taken away.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>goes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Been tryin' to get you to
notice me ever since you came; but you were so
awfully absorbed, you know!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Was I? So absorbed as all that!
What with?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Well, it looked like it&mdash;with
talkin' to your poetical friend.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>flushing</i>). He is not <em>my</em> friend in
particular; I&mdash;I admire his poetry, of course.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Can't even speak
of him without a change of colour. Bad sign that!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) You always <em>were</em> keen about poetry and
literature and that in the old days, weren't you?
Used to rag me for not readin' enough. But I do
now. I was readin' a book only last week. I'll tell
you the name if you give me a minute to think&mdash;book
everybody's readin' just now&mdash;no end of a
clever book.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span> <i>rushes across to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Maisie, dear, how are you? You

Do tell me&mdash;is that really the author of
<i>Andromeda</i> drinking tea close by? You're a <em>great</em>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>with shy adoration</i>). Oh, Mr.
Spurrell, I feel as if I <em>must</em> talk to you about
<i>Andromeda</i>. I <em>did</em> so admire it!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Another of 'em! They seem
uncommonly sweet on "bulls" in this house! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Very glad to hear you say so, I'm sure. But I'm
bound to say she's about as near perfection as
anything <em>I</em> ever&mdash;I dare say you went over her
points&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Indeed, I believe none of them
were lost upon me; but my poor little praise must
seem so worthless and ignorant!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>indulgently</i>). Oh, I wouldn't say <em>that</em>. I
find some ladies very knowing about these things.
I'm having a picture done of her.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Are you really? <em>How</em> delightful!
As a frontispiece?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Eh? Oh no&mdash;full length, and sideways&mdash;so
as to show her legs, you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Her legs? Oh, of <em>course</em>&mdash;with
"her roseal toes cramped." I thought that such a
<em>wonderful</em> touch!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> They're not more cramped than they
ought to be; she never turned them <em>in</em>, you
know!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>mystified</i>). I didn't suppose she did.
And now tell me&mdash;if it's not an indiscreet question&mdash;when
do you expect there'll be another edition?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Another addition! <em>She's</em>
cadging for a pup now! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh&mdash;er&mdash;really&mdash;couldn't
say.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> I'm sure the first must be disposed
of by this time. I shall look out for the next <em>so</em>
eagerly!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Time I "off"ed it. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Afraid I can't say anything definite&mdash;and, excuse me
leaving you, but I think Lady Culverin is looking
my way.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Oh, by all <em>means</em>? (<i>To herself.</i>) I
might as well praise a pillar-post! And after spending
quite half an hour reading him up, too! I
wonder if Bertie Pilliner was right; but I shall have
him all to myself at dinner.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> And where is Rupert? too busy of

he may understand what a sister is&mdash;when it's too
late. Ah, here's our nice unassuming young poet

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Better give her the chance

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>in a whisper</i>). Isn't he <em>deliciously</em>
unsophisticated? Quite a child of nature! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
My dear Mr. Spurrell, he wants your keys to unlock
your portmanteau and put out your things; you'll
be able to dress for dinner all the quicker.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Do you mean&mdash;am I to have the honour
of sitting down to table with all of <em>you</em>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Oh, my goodness, what
<em>will</em> Rupert say? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, of course, Mr.
Spurrell; how can you ask?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>feebly</i>). I&mdash;I didn't know, that was all.
(<i>To</i> Footman.) Here you are, then. (<i>To himself.</i>)
Put out my things?&mdash;he'll find nothing to put out
except a nightgown, sponge bag, and a couple of
brushes! If I'd only known I should be let in for
this, I'd have brought dress-clothes. But how <em>could</em>
I? I&mdash;I wonder if it would be any good telling 'em
quietly how it is. I shouldn't like 'em to think I
hadn't got any. (<i>He looks at</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> <i>and her
sister-in-law, who are talking in an undertone</i>.) No,
perhaps I'd better let it alone. I&mdash;I can allude to
it in a joky sort of way when I come down!</p>

<small>SURPRISES&mdash;AGREEABLE AND OTHERWISE</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Amber Boudoir.</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>has just entered</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Ha, Maisie, my dear, glad to see you!
Well, Rohesia, how are you, eh? You're <em>looking</em>
uncommonly well! No idea you were here!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Sir Rupert! He'll hoof me
out of this pretty soon, I expect!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>aggrieved</i>). We have been in the
house for the best part of an hour, Rupert&mdash;as you
might have discovered by inquiring&mdash;but no doubt
you preferred your comfort to welcoming so unimportant
a guest as your sister!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Beginning already!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Very sorry&mdash;got rather wet riding&mdash;had
to change everything. And I knew Albinia was
here.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>magnanimously</i>). Well, we won't
begin to quarrel the moment we meet; and you are
forgetting your other guest. (<i>In an undertone.</i>) Mr.
Spurrell&mdash;the poet&mdash;wrote <i>Andromeda</i>. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Mr. Spurrell, come and let me present you to my
brother.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Ah, how d'ye do? (<i>To himself, as he
shakes hands.</i>) What the deuce am I to say to this
fellow? (<i>Aloud.</i>) Glad to see you here, Mr.
Spurrell&mdash;heard all about you&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>, eh?
Hope you'll manage to amuse yourself while you're
with us; afraid there's not much you can do <em>now</em>
though.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Horse in a bad way; time
they let me see it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, we must see,
sir; I'll do all <em>I</em> can.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> You see, the shooting's <em>done</em> now.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, professionally piqued</i>). They
might have waited till I'd seen the horse before they
shot him! After calling me in like this! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Sir Rupert. I wish I
could have got here earlier, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Wish we'd asked you a month ago,
if you're fond of shooting. Thought you might look
down on sport, perhaps.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Sport? Why, he's talking
of <em>birds</em>&mdash;not the horse! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Me, Sir Rupert?
Not <em>much</em>! I'm as keen on a day's gunning as
any man, though I don't often get the chance
now.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to himself, pleased</i>). Come, he don't
seem strong against the Game Laws! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Thought you didn't look as if you sat over your desk
all day! There's hunting still, of course. Don't
know whether you ride?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Rather so, sir! Why, I was born and
bred in a sporting county, and as long as my old
uncle was alive, I could go down to his farm and
get a run with the hounds now and again.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>delighted</i>). Capital! Well, our next
meet is on Tuesday&mdash;best part of the country; nearly
all grass, and nice clean post and rails. You must
stay over for it. Got a mare that will carry your
weight perfectly, and I think I can promise you a
run&mdash;eh, what do you say?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, in surprise</i>). He <em>is</em> a chummy
old cock! I'll wire old Spavin that I'm detained on
biz; and I'll tell 'em to send my riding-breeches and
dress-clothes down! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It's uncommonly
kind of you, sir, and I think I can manage to stop
on a bit.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Rupert must be out of
his senses! It's bad enough to have him here till
Monday! (<i>Aloud.</i>) We mustn't forget, Rupert,
how valuable Mr. Spurrell's time is; it would be
too selfish of us to detain him here a day longer
than&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> My dear, Mr. Spurrell has already
said he can <em>manage</em> it; so we may all enjoy his
society with a clear conscience. (Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>
<i>conceals her sentiments with difficulty</i>.) And now,
Albinia, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to my
room and rest a little, as I'm rather overdone, and
you have all these tiresome people coming to dinner
to-night.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She rises and leaves the room; the other ladies
follow her example.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Rupert, I'm going up now with
Rohesia. You know where we've put Mr. Spurrell,
don't you? The Verney Chamber.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Take you up now, if you like, Mr.
Spurrell&mdash;it's only just seven, though. Suppose you
don't take an hour to dress, eh?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh dear no, sir, nothing like it! (<i>To
himself.</i>) Won't take me two minutes as I am now!
I'd better tell him&mdash;I can say my bag hasn't come.
I don't believe it <em>has</em>, and, anyway, it's a good
excuse. (<i>Aloud.</i>) The&mdash;the fact is, Sir Rupert, I'm
afraid that my luggage has been unfortunately left
behind.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> No luggage, eh? Well, well, it's of
no consequence. But I'll ask about it&mdash;I dare say
it's all right.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>). Sure to have
turned up, you know&mdash;man will have seen that.
Shouldn't altogether object to a glass of sherry and
bitters before dinner. Don't know how <em>you</em> feel&mdash;suppose
you've a soul <em>above</em> sherry and bitters,
though?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Not at this moment. But I'd soon <em>put</em>
my soul above a sherry and bitters if I got a chance!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>after reflection</i>). I say, you
know, that's rather smart, eh? (<i>To himself.</i>) Aw'fly
clever sort of chap, this, but not stuck up&mdash;not half
a bad sort, if he <em>is</em> a bit of a bounder. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Anythin'
in the evenin' paper? Don't get 'em down here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;I SAY, YOU KNOW, THAT&#39;S RATHER SMART, EH?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Nothing much. I see there's an objection
to Monkey-tricks.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>startled</i>). No, by Jove! Hope
they'll overrule it&mdash;make a lot of difference to me
if they don't.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Don't fancy there's much in it. Your
money's safe enough, I expect. Have you any particular
fancy for the Grand National? I know
something that's safe to win, bar accidents&mdash;a dead
cert, sir! Got the tip straight from the stable.
You just take my advice, and pile all you can on
Jumping Joan.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>later, to himself, after a long
and highly interesting conversation</i>). Thunderin' clever
chap&mdash;never knew poets <em>were</em> such clever chaps.
Might be a "bookie," by Gad! No wonder Maisie
thinks such a lot of him!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He sighs.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>returning</i>). Now, Mr. Spurrell, if
you'll come upstairs with me, I'll show you your
quarters. By the way, I've made inquiries about
your luggage, and I think you'll find it's all right.
(<i>As he leads the way up the staircase.</i>) Rather
awkward for you if you'd had to come down to dinner
just as you are, eh?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Oh, lor, my beastly bag <em>has</em>
come after all! Now they'll <em>know</em> I didn't bring
a dress suit. What an owl I was to tell him!
(<i>Aloud, feebly.</i>) Oh&mdash;er&mdash;very awkward indeed, Sir
Rupert!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>stopping at a bedroom door</i>). Verney
Chamber&mdash;here you are. Ah, my wife forgot to have
your name put on the door&mdash;better do it now, eh?
(<i>He writes it on the card in the door-plate.</i>) There&mdash;well,
hope you'll find it all comfortable&mdash;we dine at
eight, you know. You've plenty of time for all
you've got to do!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If I only knew <em>what</em> to do!
I shall never have the cheek to come down as I am!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He enters the Verney Chamber dejectedly.</i></p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In an Upper Corridor in the East Wing.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Steward's Room Boy</i> (to <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). This is
your room, sir&mdash;you'll find a fire lit and all.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>scathingly</i>). A fire? For me! I
scarcely expected such an indulgence. You are <em>sure</em>
there's no mistake?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> This is the room I was told, sir. You'll find
candles on the mantelpiece, and matches.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Every luxury indeed! I am pampered&mdash;<em>pampered</em>!</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> Yes, sir. And I was to say as supper's at
ar-past nine, but Mrs. Pomfret would be 'appy to
see you in the Pugs' Parlour whenever you pleased
to come down and set there.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> The Pugs' Parlour?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> What we call the 'ousekeeper's room, among
ourselves, sir.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Mrs. Pomfret does me too much honour.
And shall I have the satisfaction of seeing your
intelligent countenance at the festive board, my lad?</p>

<p><i>Boy</i> (<i>giggling</i>). On'y to <em>wait</em>, sir. I don't set down
to meals along with the <em>upper</em> servants, sir!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> And I&mdash;a mere man of genius&mdash;<em>do</em>!
These distinctions must strike you as most arbitrary;
but restrain any natural envy, my young
friend. I assure you I am not puffed up by this
promotion!</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> No, sir. (<i>To himself, as he goes out.</i>) I
believe he's a bit dotty, I do. I don't understand
a word he's been a-talking of!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>alone, surveying the surroundings</i>). A
cockloft, with a painted iron bedstead, a smoky
chimney, no bell, and a text over the mantelpiece!
Thank Heaven, that fellow Drysdale can't see me
here! But I will not sleep in this place, my pride
will only just bear the strain of staying to supper&mdash;no
more. And I'm hanged if I go down to the
housekeeper's room till hunger drives me. It's not
eight yet&mdash;how shall I pass the time? Ha, I see
they've favoured me with pen and ink. I will
invoke the Muse. Indignation should make verses,
as it did for Juvenal; and <em>he</em> was never set down to
sup with slaves!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He writes.</i></p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In the Verney Chamber.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). My word, what a room!
Carpet hung all over the walls, big fourposter, carved
ceiling, great fireplace with blazing logs,&mdash;if this is
how they do a <em>vet</em> here, what price the <em>other</em> fellows'
rooms? And to think I shall have to do without
dinner, just when I was getting on with 'em all so
swimmingly! I <em>must</em>. I can't, for the credit of the
profession&mdash;to say nothing of the firm&mdash;turn up in a
monkey jacket and tweed bags, and that's all <em>I've</em>
got except a nightgown!... It's all very well for
Lady Maisie to say, "Take everything as it comes,"
but if she was in <em>my</em> fix!... And it isn't as if
I hadn't <em>got</em> dress things either. If only I'd brought
'em down, I'd have marched in to dinner as cool as
a&mdash;&mdash; (<i>he lights a pair of candles.</i>) Hullo! What's
that on the bed? (<i>He approaches it.</i>) Shirt! white
tie! socks! coat, waistcoat, trousers&mdash;they <em>are</em> dress
clothes!... And here's a pair of brushes on the
table! I'll swear they're not <em>mine</em>&mdash;there's a monogram
on them&mdash;"U.G." What does it all mean?
Why, of course! regular old trump, Sir Rupert, and
naturally he wants me to do him credit. He saw
how it was, and he's gone and rigged me out! In
a house like this, they're ready for emergencies&mdash;keep
all sizes in stock, I dare say.... It isn't
"U.G." on the brushes&mdash;it's "G.U."&mdash;"Guest's Use."
Well, this is what I call doing the thing in style!
<em>Cinderella's</em> nothing to it! Only hope they're a
decent fit. (<i>Later, as he dresses.</i>) Come, the shirt's
all right; trousers a trifle short&mdash;but they'll let
down; waistcoat&mdash;whew, must undo the buckle&mdash;hang
it, it <em>is</em> undone! I feel like a hooped barrel in
it! Now the coat&mdash;easy does it. Well, it's <em>on</em>; but
I shall have to be peeled like a walnut to get it off
again.... Shoes? ah, here they are&mdash;pair of
pumps. Phew&mdash;must have come from the Torture
Exhibition in Leicester Square; glass slippers nothing
to 'em! But they'll have to do at a pinch; and
they <em>do</em> pinch like blazes! Ha, ha, that's good! I
must tell that to the Captain. (<i>He looks at himself
in a mirror.</i>) Well, I can't say they're up to mine
for cut and general style; but they're passable. And
now I'll go down to the drawing-room and get on
terms with all the smarties!</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Chinese Drawing-room at Wyvern.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;7.50.
Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>is alone, glancing over a
written list</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>entering</i>). Down already, Albinia?
I <em>thought</em> if I made haste I should get a quiet chat
with you before anybody else came in. What is
that paper? Oh, the list of couples for Rupert.
May I see? (<i>As</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>surrenders it</i>.) My
dear, you're <em>not</em> going to inflict that mincing little
Pilliner boy on poor Maisie! That really <em>won't do</em>.
At least let her have somebody she used to. Why
not Captain Thicknesse? He's an old friend, and
she's not seen him for months. I must alter that,
if you've no objection. (<i>She does.</i>) And then you've
given my poor poet to that Spelwane girl! Now,
<em>why</em>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I thought she wouldn't mind putting
up with him just for one evening.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Wouldn't <em>mind</em>! Putting up with
him! And is that how you speak of a celebrity
when you are so fortunate as to have one to entertain?
<em>Really</em>, Albinia!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> But, my dear Rohesia, you must
allow that, whatever his talents may be, he is not&mdash;well,
not <em>quite</em> one of Us. Now, <em>is</em> he?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>blandly</i>). My dear, I never heard
he had any connection with the manufacture of
chemical manures, in which your worthy papa so
greatly distinguished himself&mdash;if <em>that</em> is what you
mean.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>with some increase of colour</i>). That
is <em>not</em> what I meant, Rohesia&mdash;as you know perfectly
well. And I do say that this Mr. Spurrell's manner
is most objectionable; when he's not obsequious, he's
horribly familiar!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>sharply</i>). I have not observed it.
He strikes me as well enough&mdash;for that class of
person. And it is intellect, soul, all that kind of
thing that <em>I</em> value. I look <em>below</em> the surface, and
I find a great deal that is very original and charming
in this young man. And surely, my dear, if I find
myself able to associate with him, <em>you</em> need not be so
fastidious! I consider him my <i>protégé</i>, and I won't
have him slighted. He is far too good for Vivien
Spelwane!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>with just a suspicion of malice</i>).
Perhaps, Rohesia, you would like him to take <em>you</em>
in?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> That, of course, is quite out of the
question. I see you have given me the Bishop&mdash;he's
a poor, dry stick of a man&mdash;never forgets he
was the Headmaster of Swisham&mdash;but he's always
glad to meet <em>me</em>. I freshen him up so.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> I really don't know whom I <em>can</em>
give Mr. Spurrell. There's Rhoda Cokayne, but she's
not poetical, and she'll get on much better with
Archie Bearpark. Oh, I forgot Mrs. Brooke-Chatteris&mdash;she's
sure to <em>talk</em>, at all events.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>as she corrects the list</i>). A lively,
agreeable woman&mdash;she'll amuse him. <em>Now</em> you can
give Rupert the list.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>and various members of the
house-party appear one by one</i>; Lord
<i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>, <i>the</i> Bishop of

Mrs. <span class="smcap">Earwaker</span>, <i>and</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span> <i>are
announced at intervals; salutations, recognitions,
and commonplaces are exchanged</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>later&mdash;to the</i> Bishop, <i>genially</i>). Ah,
my dear Bishop, you and I haven't met since we had
our great battle about&mdash;now, was it the necessity of
throwing open the Public Schools to the lower
classes&mdash;for whom of course they were originally
<em>intended</em>&mdash;or was it the failure of the Church to
reach the working man? I really forget.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>who has a holy horror of the</i> Countess).
I&mdash;ah&mdash;fear I cannot charge my memory so precisely,
my dear Lady Cantire. We&mdash;ah&mdash;differ unfortunately
on so many subjects. I trust, however,
we may&mdash;ah&mdash;agree to suspend hostilities on this
occasion?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>with even more bonhomie</i>). Don't be
too sure of <em>that</em>, Bishop. I've several crows to pluck
with you, and we are to go in to dinner together,
you know!</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> Indeed? I had no conception that
such a pleasure was in store for me! (<i>To himself.</i>)
This must be the penance for breaking my rule of
never dining out on Saturday! Severe&mdash;but not
unmerited!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I wonder, Bishop, if you have seen
this wonderful volume of poetry that every one is
talking about&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>?</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>conscientiously</i>). I chanced only this
morning, by way of momentary relaxation, to take
up a journal containing a notice of that work, with
copious extracts. The impression left on my mind
was&mdash;ah&mdash;unfavourable; a certain talent, no doubt,
some felicity of expression, but a noticeable lack of
the&mdash;ah&mdash;reticence, the discipline, the&mdash;the scholarly
touch which a training at one of our great Public
Schools (I forbear to particularise), and at a
University, can alone impart. I was also pained
to observe a crude discontent with the existing
Social System&mdash;a system which, if not absolutely
perfect, cannot be upset or even modified without
the gravest danger. But I was still more distressed
to note in several passages a decided taint of the
morbid sensuousness which renders so much of our
modern literature sickly and unwholesome.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> All prejudice, my dear Bishop;
why, you haven't even <em>read</em> the book! However,
the author is staying here now, and I feel convinced
that if you only knew him, you'd alter your
opinion. Such an unassuming, inoffensive creature!
There, he's just come in. I'll call him over
here.... Goodness, why does he shuffle along in
that way!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>meeting</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>). Hope I've kept
nobody waiting for <em>me</em>, Sir Rupert. (<i>Confidentially.</i>)
I'd rather a job to get these things on; but they're
really a wonderful fit, considering!</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> That's right, Mr. Spurrell. Come
here, and let me present you to the Bishop of
Birchester. The Bishop has just been telling me
he considers your <i>Andromeda</i> sickly, or unhealthy,
or something. I'm sure you'll be able to convince
him it's nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She leaves him with the</i> Bishop, <i>who is visibly
annoyed</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, overawed</i>). Oh, Lor! Wish I
knew the right way to talk to a Bishop. Can't call
<em>him</em> nothing&mdash;so doosid familiar. (<i>Aloud.</i>) <i>Andromeda</i>
sickly, your&mdash;(<i>tentatively</i>)&mdash;your Right Reverence?
Not a bit of it&mdash;sound as a roach!</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> If I had thought my&mdash;ah&mdash;criticisms
were to be repeated&mdash;I might say misrepresented,
as the Countess has thought proper to do, Mr.
Spurrell, I should not have ventured to make them.
At the same time, you must be conscious yourself, I
think, of certain blemishes which would justify the
terms I employed.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I never saw any in <i>Andromeda</i> myself,
your&mdash;your Holiness. You're the first to find a fault
in her. I don't say there mayn't be something
dicky about the setting and the turn of the tail, but
that's a trifle.</p>

<p><i>The Bishop.</i> I did not refer to the setting of the
tale, and the portions I object to are scarcely trifles.
But pardon me if I prefer to end a discussion that
can hardly be other than unprofitable. (<i>To himself,
as he turns on his heel.</i>) A most arrogant, self-satisfied,
and conceited young man&mdash;a truly lamentable
product of this half-educated age!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Well, he may be a dab at
dogmas&mdash;he don't know much about dogs. Drummy's
got a constitution worth a dozen of <em>his</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>approaching him</i>). Oh, Mr. Spurrell,
Lord Lullington is most anxious to know you. If
you will come with me. (<i>To herself, as she leads
him up to</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>.) I do <em>wish</em> Rohesia
wouldn't force me to do this sort of thing!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She presents him.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord Lullington</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I suppose I <em>ought</em> to
know all about his novel, or whatever it is he's
done. (<i>Aloud, with courtliness.</i>) Very pleased to
make your acquaintance, Mr. Spurrell; you've&mdash;ah&mdash;delighted
the world by your <i>Andromeda</i>. When
are we to look for your next production? Soon, I
hope.</p>

Expect you to give us your best, you know.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He turns to continue a conversation.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <em>Give</em> it! He won't get it

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He brings his literary
disappointments to <em>me</em>, not Maisie! (<i>Aloud, with
the sweetest sympathy.</i>) How dreadfully unjust!
Oh, I've dropped my fan&mdash;no, pray don't trouble;
I can pick it up. My arms are so long, you know&mdash;like
a kangaroo's&mdash;no, what is that animal which
has such long arms? You're so clever, you <em>ought</em> to
know!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I suppose you mean a gorilla?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> How crushing of you! But you
must go away now, or else you'll find nothing to
say to me at dinner&mdash;you take me in, you know.
I hope you feel privileged. <em>I</em> feel&mdash;&mdash; But if I told
you, I might make you too conceited!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>gracefully</i>). Oh, it's not so easily done as
all <em>that</em>!</p>

Wyvern</i>. <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About</i> 9 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Steward's Room Boy</i> (<i>knocking and entering</i>).
Brought you up some 'ot water, sir, case you'd like
to clean up afore supper.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I presume evening dress is not indispensable
in the housekeeper's room; but I can hardly
make even the simplest toilet until you are good
enough to bring up my portmanteau. Where is it?</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> I never 'eard nothink of no porkmanteau,
sir!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You will hear a good deal about it,
unless it is forthcoming at once. Just find out what's
become of it&mdash;a new portmanteau, with a white star
painted on it.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>The Boy retires, impressed. An interval.</i></p>

<p><i>Boy</i> (<i>reappearing</i>). I managed to get a few words
with Thomas, our second footman, just as he was
coming out o' the 'all, and <em>he</em> sez the only porkmanteau
with a white star was took up to the Verney
Chamber, which Thomas unpacked it hisself.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Then tell Thomas, with my compliments,
that he will trouble himself to pack it again
immediately.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> But Thomas has to wait at table, and besides,
he says as he laid out the dress things, and the
gen'lman as is in the Verney Chamber is a wearin'
of 'em now, sir.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>indignant</i>). But they're <em>mine</em>! Confound
his impudence! Here, I'll write him a line at
once. (<i>He scribbles a note.</i>) There, see that the
gentleman of the Verney Chamber gets this at once,
and bring me his answer.</p>

<p><i>Boy.</i> What! <em>me</em> go into the dinin'-'all, with all
the swells at table? I dursn't. I should get the
sack from old Treddy.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I don't care who takes it so long as it
<em>is</em> taken. Tell Thomas it's <em>his</em> mistake, and he must
do what he can to put it right. Say I shall certainly
complain if I don't get back my clothes and portmanteau.
Get that note delivered somehow, and I'll give
you half-a-crown. (<i>To himself, as the</i> Boy <i>departs,
much against his will.</i>) If Lady Culverin doesn't
consider me fit to appear at her dinner-table, I don't
see why my evening clothes should be more privileged!</p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In the Dining-hall. The table is oval</i>; <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> <i>is
placed between</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda Cokayne</span> <i>and</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Brooke-Chatteris</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>encouragingly, after they are seated</i>).
Now, I shall expect you to be very brilliant and
entertaining. <em>I</em>'ll do all the listening for once in a
way&mdash;though, generally, I can talk about all manner
of silly things with <em>anybody</em>!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>extremely ill at ease</i>). Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I should
say you were quite equal to <em>that</em>. But I really can't
think of anything to talk <em>about</em>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> That's a bad beginning. I always
find the <i>menu</i> cards such a good subject, when there's
anything at all out of the common about them. If
they're ornamented, you <em>can</em> talk about them&mdash;though
not for <em>very</em> long at a time, don't you think?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>miserably</i>). I can't say how long I could
go on about <em>ornamented</em> ones&mdash;but these are plain.
(<i>To himself.</i>) I can hear this waistcoat going
already&mdash;and we're only at the soup!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> It <em>is</em> a pity. Never mind; tell me
about literary and artistic people. Do you know,
I'm rather glad I'm not literary or artistic myself;
it seems to make people so <em>queer-looking</em>, somehow.
Oh, of course I didn't mean <em>you</em> looked queer&mdash;but
<em>generally</em>, you know. You've made quite a success
with your <i>Andromeda</i>, haven't you? I only go by
what I'm told&mdash;I don't read much myself. We
women have so many really serious matters to
attend to&mdash;arranging about dinners, and visits, and
trying on frocks, and then rushing about from party
to party. I so seldom get a quiet moment. Ah, I
knew I wanted to ask you something. Did you
ever know any one called Lady Grisoline?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Lady&mdash;er&mdash;Grisoline? No; can't say I
do. I know Lady Maisie, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> Oh, and <em>she</em> was the original? Now,
that <em>is</em> exciting! But I should hardly have recognised
her&mdash;"lanky," you know, and "slanting green
eyes." But I suppose you see everybody differently
from other people? It's having so much imagination.
I dare say <em>I</em> look green or something to you now&mdash;though
really I'm <em>not</em>.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I don't understand more than
about half she's saying. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, I don't see
anything particularly green about <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>only partially pleased</i>). I wonder if
you meant that to be complimentary&mdash;no, you
needn't explain. Now, tell me, is there any news
about the Laureateship? Who's going to get it?
Will it be Swinburne or Lewis Morris?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Never heard of the stakes or
the horses either. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, to tell you the
truth, I haven't been following their form&mdash;too many
of these small events nowadays.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It's quite amusing
how jealous these poets are of one another! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Is it true they get a butt of sherry given them for it?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I've heard of winners getting a bottle or
two of champagne in a bucket&mdash;not sherry. But a
little stimulant won't hurt a crack when he comes
in, provided it's not given him too soon; wait till
he's got his wind and done blowing, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> I'm taking that in. I know it's
very witty and satirical, and I dare say I shall understand
it in time.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh, it doesn't matter much if you don't.
(<i>To himself.</i>) Pleasant kind of woman&mdash;but a perfect
fool to talk to!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I've always <em>heard</em> that
clever writers are rather stupid when you meet them&mdash;it's
quite true.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I should like her
to see that I've got some imagination in me, though
she <em>does</em> think me such an ass. (<i>Aloud, to</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Maisie</span>.) Jolly old hall this is, with the banners,
and the gallery, and that&mdash;makes you fancy some of
those old mediæval Johnnies in armour&mdash;knights,
you know&mdash;comin' clankin' in and turnin' us all
out.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I do trust Mr. Spurrell
isn't saying something too dreadful. I'm sure I
heard my name just now. (<i>Aloud, absently, to</i>
Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>.) No, did you <em>really</em>? How
amusing it must have been!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>aggrieved</i>). If you'd done me
the honour of payin' any attention to what I was
sayin', you'd have found out it <em>wasn't</em> amusin'.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>starting</i>). Oh, <em>wasn't</em> it? I'm so
sorry I missed it. I&mdash;I'm afraid I was thinking of
something else. Do tell me again!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i>, (<i>still hurt</i>). No, I won't inflict
it on you&mdash;not worth repeatin'. And I should only
be takin' off your attention from a fellow that <em>does</em>
know how to talk.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>with a guiltiness which she tries to
carry off under dignity</i>). I don't think I understand
what you mean.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Well, I couldn't help hearin'
what you said to your poet-friend before we went in
about having to put up with partners; and it isn't
what you may call flattering to a fellow's feelin's,
being put up with.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>hotly</i>). It&mdash;it was not intended for
you. You entirely misunderstood!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Dare say I'm very dense; but,
even to <em>my</em> comprehension, it's plain enough that the
reason why you weren't listenin' to me just now
was that the poet had the luck to say somethin' that
you found more interesting.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You are <em>quite</em> wrong&mdash;it's too
absurd; I never even met Mr. Spurrell in my life
till this afternoon. If you really <em>must</em> know, I
heard him mention my name, and&mdash;and I wondered,
naturally, what he could possibly be saying.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Somethin' very charmin', and
poetical, and complimentary, I'm sure, and I'm
makin' you lose it all. Apologise&mdash;shan't happen
again.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Please be sensible, and let us talk of
something else. Are you staying here long?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> You will be gratified to hear I
leave for Aldershot to-morrow. Meant to have gone
to-day. Sorry I <em>didn't</em> now.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I think it was a thousand pities you
didn't, as you seem to have stayed on purpose to be
as stupid and unkind as you possibly can.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She turns to her other neighbour</i>, Lord <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>to</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>, <i>who is on
her other side</i>). Oh, Captain Thicknesse, what <em>do</em> you
think Mr. Spurrell has just told me? You remember
those lines to Lady Grisoline that Mr.
Pilliner made such fun of this morning? Well,
they were meant for Lady Maisie! They're quite
old friends, it seems. <em>So</em> romantic! Wouldn't you
like to know how they came to meet?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Can't say I'm particularly
curious&mdash;no affair of mine, don't you know. (<i>To
himself.</i>) And she told me they'd never met before!
Sooner I get back the better. Only in the way here.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>turning to him</i>). Well, are you as
determined to be as disagreeable as ever? Oh yes,
I see you are!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> I'm hurt, that's what it is,
and I'm not clever at hiding my feelin's. Fact is,
I've just been told somethin' that&mdash;well, it's no
business of <em>mine</em>, only you <em>might</em> have been a little
more frank with an old friend, instead of leavin' it
to come through somebody else. These things always
come out, you know.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). That wretch <em>has</em> been
talking! I knew he would! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I know
I've been very foolish. If I was to tell you some
time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Oh, no reason why
you should tell me anything. Assure you, I&mdash;I'm
not curious.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> In that case I shall certainly not
trouble you. (<i>To herself.</i>) He may think just what
he pleases, <em>I</em> don't care. But, oh, if Mr. Spurrell
dares to speak to me after this, I shall astonish him!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>). I say&mdash;I <em>am</em> in a funk.
Only just heard who I'm next to. I always do feel
such a perfect fool when I've got to talk to a famous
person&mdash;and you're <em>frightfully</em> famous, aren't you?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>modestly</i>). Oh, I don't know&mdash;I suppose
I <em>am</em>, in a sort of way, through <i>Andromeda</i>. Seem
to think so <em>here</em>, anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Well, I'd better tell you at once, I'm
no good at poetry&mdash;can't make head or tail of it,
some'ow. It does seem to me such&mdash;well, such
footle. Awf'ly rude of me sayin' things like that!</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;IT DOES SEEM TO ME SUCH&mdash;WELL, SUCH FOOTLE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Is it? I'm just the same&mdash;wouldn't give
a penny a yard for poetry, myself!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> You wouldn't? I <em>am</em> glad. <em>Such</em> a
let-off for me! I was afraid you'd want to talk of
nothin' else, and the only things I can really talk
about are horses and dogs, and that kind of thing.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> That's all right, then. All I don't know
about dogs and horses you could put in a hom&oelig;opathic
globule&mdash;and <em>then</em> it would rattle!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Then you're just the man. Look

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>They converse with animation.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Do you know, Bertie, that's rather
a good idea of yours. I'll ask him to read us something
to-night.</p>

You saw me writing at dinner, and went and told

that I can see; but, as you seem to be interested,
I may tell you that I shall go up and do it in my

<small>DIGNITY UNDER DIFFICULTIES</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Housekeeper's Room at Wyvern</i>; Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>,
<i>the Housekeeper, in a black silk gown and her
smartest cap, is seated in a winged armchair by
the fire, discussing domestic politics with</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Culverin's</span> <i>maid</i>, Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span>. <i>The Chef</i>,
<span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>, <i>is resting on the sofa, in languid

makes himself agreeable to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>who
is in demi-toilette, as are all the other ladies' maids
present</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Stickler</i> (<i>in an impressive undertone</i>). All I
<em>do</em> say, Mrs. Pomfret, ma'am, is this: if that girl
Louisa marches into the pew to-morrow, as she did
<em>last</em> Sunday, before the second laundry maid&mdash;and
her only under-scullery maid&mdash;such presumptiousness
should be put a stop to in future!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret</i> (<i>wheezily</i>). Depend upon it, my dear,
it's her ignorance; but I shall most certainly speak
about it. Girls must be taught that ranks was made
to be respected, and the precedency into that pew
has come down from time immemoriable, and is not
to be set aside by such as her while <em>I</em>'m 'ousekeeper
here.</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon</i> (<i>in French, to</i> <span class="smcap">M. Ridevos</span>). You
have the air fatigued, my poor friend! Oh, there&mdash;but
fatigued!</p>

<p><i>M. Ridevos.</i> Broken, Mademoiselle, absolutely
broken. But what will you? This night I surpass
myself. I achieve a masterpiece&mdash;a sublime pyramid
of quails with a sauce that will become classic. I
pay now the penalty of a veritable crisis of nerves.
It is of my temperament as artist.</p>

<p><i>Mlle. Chiffon.</i> And me, my poor friend, how I have
suffered from the cookery of these others&mdash;I who
have the stomach so feeble, so fastidious! Figure
to yourself an existence upon the villainous curry,
the abominable "Iahristue," beloved by these barbarians,
but which succeed with me not at all&mdash;oh,
but not at all! Since I am here&mdash;ah, the difference!
I digest as of old&mdash;I am gay. But next week to
return with mademoiselle to the curry, my poor
friend, what regrets!</p>

<p><i>M. Ridevos.</i> For me, dear mademoiselle, for me
the regrets&mdash;to hear no more the conversation, so
spiritual, so sympathetic, of a fellow-countrywoman.
For remark that here they are stupid&mdash;they comprehend
not. And the old ones they roll at me the eyes
to make terror. Behold this Gorgon who approaches.
She adores me, my word of honour, this ruin!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Miss <span class="smcap">Stickler</span> <i>comes up to the sofa smiling in

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>advancing to meet</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Dolman</span>, <i>who

<p><i>Miss Dolman</i> (<i>checking her with a look</i>). Her grace?
No, we parted some time ago. I'm with Lady Rhoda
Cokayne at present. (<i>In an undertone, as she takes
her aside.</i>) You needn't say anything here of your
having known me at Mrs. Dickenson's. I couldn't
afford to have it get about in the circle I'm in that
I'd ever lived with any but the nobility. I'm sure
you see what I mean. Of course I don't mind your
saying we've <em>met</em>.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Oh, I <em>quite</em> understand. I'll say
nothing. I'm obliged to be careful myself, being
maid to Lady Maisie Mull.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolman.</i> My <em>dear</em> Emma! It <em>is</em> nice seeing
you again&mdash;such <em>friends</em> as we used to be!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> At her Grace's? I'm afraid you're
thinking of somebody else. (<i>She crosses to</i> Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Pomfret</span>.) Mrs. Pomfret, what's become of the
gentleman I travelled down with&mdash;the horse doctor?
I do hope he means to come in; he would amuse
<em>you</em>, Mr. Steptoe. I never heard anybody go on like
him; he <em>did</em> make me laugh so!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> I really can't say <em>where</em> he is, my
dear. I sent up word to let him know he was
welcome here whenever he pleased; but perhaps he's
feeling a little shy about coming down.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Oh, I don't think he suffers much from
<em>that</em>. (<i>As the door opens.</i>) Ah, <em>there</em> he is!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret</i> (<i>rising, with dignity, to receive</i>
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>who enters in obvious embarrassment</i>).
Come in, sir. I'm glad to see you've found your
way down at last. Let me see, I haven't the
advantage of knowing your&mdash;Mr. Undershell, <em>to</em> be
sure! Well, Mr. Undershell, we're very pleased to
see you. I hope you'll make yourself quite at home.
Her ladyship gave particular directions that we was
to look after you&mdash;<em>most</em> particular she was!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You are very good, ma'am. I am
obliged to Lady Culverin for her (<i>with a gulp</i>) condescension.
But I shall not trespass more than a
short time upon your hospitality.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> Don't speak of it as trespassing, sir.
It's not often we have a gentleman of your profession
as a visitor, but you are none the less welcome.
Now I'd better introduce you all round, and then
you won't feel yourself a stranger. Miss Phillipson
you <em>have</em> met, I know.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She introduces him to the others in turn</i>;
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>bows helplessly</i>.</p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>with urbanity</i>). Your fame, sir, has preceded
you. And you'll find us a very friendly and
congenial little circle on a better acquaintance&mdash;if
this is your first experience of this particular form of
society?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I mustn't be stiff, I'll put
them at their ease. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, I must admit,
Mr. Steptoe, that I have never before had the
privilege of entering the&mdash;(<i>with an ingratiating smile
all round him</i>) the "Pugs' Parlour," as I understand
you call this very charming room.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>The company draw themselves up and cough
in disapprobation.</i></p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>very stiffly</i>). Pardon <em>me</em>, sir, you have
been totally misinformed. Such an expression is
not current <em>here</em>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret</i> (<i>more stiffly still</i>). It is never alluded
to in <em>my</em> presence except as the 'ousekeeper's room,
which is the right and proper name for it. There
may be some other term for it in the servants' 'all
for anything <em>I</em> know to the contrary&mdash;but, if you'll
excuse me for saying so, Mr. Undershell, we'd prefer
for it not to be repeated in <em>our</em> presence.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>confusedly</i>). I&mdash;I beg ten thousand
pardons. (<i>To himself.</i>) To be pulled up like this
for trying to be genial&mdash;it's really <em>too</em> humiliating!</p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>relaxing</i>). Well, well, sir; we must make
some allowances for a neophyte. You'll know
better another time, <em>I</em> dare say. Miss Phillipson
here has been giving you a very favourable character
as a highly agreeable rattle, Mr. Undershell. I hope
we may be favoured with a specimen of your social
talents later on. We're always grateful here for
anything in that way&mdash;such as a recitation now, or a
comic song, or a yumorous imitation&mdash;anything, in
short, calculated to promote the general harmony
and festivity will be appreciated.</p>

<p><i>Miss Stickler</i> (<i>acidly</i>). Provided it is free from any
helement of coarseness, which we do <em>not</em> encourage&mdash;far
from it!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>suppressing his irritation</i>). You need
be under no alarm, madam. I do not propose to
attempt a performance of <em>any</em> kind.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Don't be so solemn, Mr. Undershell!
I'm sure you can be as comical as any play-actor
when you choose!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I really don't know how I can have
given you that impression. If you expect me to
treat my lyre like a <em>horse-collar</em>, and grin through it,
I'm afraid I am unable to gratify you.</p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>at sea</i>). Capital, sir, the professional allusion
very neat. You'll come out presently, <em>I</em> can
see, when supper's on the table. Can't expect you
to rattle till you've something <em>inside</em> of you,
can we?</p>

<p><i>Miss Stickler.</i> Reelly, Mr. Steptoe, I <em>am</em> surprised
at such commonness from <em>you</em>!</p>

<p><i>Steptoe.</i> Now you're too severe, Miss Stickler, you
are indeed. An innocent little Judy Mow like
that!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>outside</i>). Don't answer <em>me</em>, sir. Ham I
butler 'ere, or ham I <em>not</em>? I've a precious good
mind to report you for such a hignorant blunder....
I don't want to hear another word about the gentleman's
cloes&mdash;you'd no hearthly business for to do
such a thing at all! (<i>He enters and flings himself
down on a chair.</i>) That Thomas is beyond everything&mdash;stoopid
<em>hass</em> as he is!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret</i> (<i>concerned</i>). La, Mr. Tredwell, you
<em>do</em> seem put out! Whatever have Thomas been
doing <em>now</em>?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's really very good of
him to take it to heart like this! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Pray
don't let it distress you; it's of no consequence,
none at all!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>glaring</i>). I'm the best judge of that,
Mr. Undershell, sir&mdash;if you'll allow <em>me</em>; <em>I</em> don't call
my porogatives of no consequence, whatever <em>you</em>
may! And that feller Thomas, Mrs. Pomfret,
actially 'ad the hordacity, without consulting me
previous, to go and 'and a note to one of our gentlemen
at the hupstairs table, all about some hassinine
mistake he'd made with his cloes! What call had
he to take it upon himself? I feel puffecly disgraced
that such a thing should have occurred under
my authority!</p>

wag, don't you see? He's only trying to pull your
leg, that's all; and, Gad, he did it too! But you

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> I don't see Mr. Adams here this evening,
Mrs. Pomfret. What's the reason of that?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> Why, he asked to be excused to-night,
Mr. Tredwell. You see some of the visitors'
coachmen are putting up their horses here, and he's
helping Mr. Checkley entertain them. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.)
Mr. Adams is our stud-groom, and him
and Mr. Checkley, the 'ed coachman, are very
friendly just now. Adams is very clever with his
horses, I believe, and I'm sure he'd have liked a talk
with you; it's a pity he's engaged elsewhere this
evening.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>mystified</i>). I&mdash;I'm exceedingly sorry
to have missed him, ma'am. (<i>To himself.</i>) Is the
stud-groom <em>literary</em>, I wonder?... Ah, no, I remember
now; I allowed Miss Phillipson to conclude
that my tastes were equestrian. Perhaps it's just as
well the stud-groom <em>isn't</em> here!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> Well, he <em>may</em> drop in later on. I
shouldn't be surprised if you and he had met before.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <em>I</em> should. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I
hardly think it's probable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> I've known stranger things than
<em>that</em> happen. Why, only the other day, a gentleman
came into this very room, as it might be yourself,
and it struck me he was looking very hard at me,
and by and bye he says, "You don't recollect <em>me</em>,
ma'am, but I know <em>you</em> very well," says he. So I
said to him, "You certainly have the advantage of
me at present, sir." "Well, ma'am," he says, "many
years ago I had the honour and privilege of being
steward's room boy in a house where you was still-room
maid; and I consider I owe the position I
have since attained entirely to the good advice you
used to give me, as I've never forgot it, ma'am,"
says he. Then it flashed across me who it was&mdash;"Mr.
Pocklington!" says I. Which it <em>were</em>. And
him own man to the Duke of Dumbleshire! Which
was what made it so very nice and 'andsome of him
to remember me all that time.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>perfunctorily</i>). It must have been
most gratifying, ma'am. (<i>To himself.</i>) I hope this
old lady hasn't any more anecdotes of this highly
interesting nature. I mustn't neglect Miss Phillipson&mdash;especially
as I haven't very long to stay here.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He consults his watch stealthily.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Phillipson</i> (<i>observing the action</i>). I'm sorry you
find it so slow here; it's not very polite of you to show
it quite so openly though, I must say.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She pouts.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I can't let this poor girl
think me a brute! But I must be careful not to go
too far. (<i>To her, in an undertone which he tries to
render unemotional.</i>) Don't misunderstand me like
that. If I looked at my watch, it was merely to
count the minutes that are left. In one short half-hour
I must go&mdash;I must pass out of your life, and
you must forget&mdash;oh, it will be easy for <em>you</em>&mdash;but for
<em>me</em>, ah! you cannot think that I shall carry away a
heart entirely unscathed! Believe me, I shall always
look back gratefully, regretfully, on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>bending her head with a gratified little
giggle</i>). I declare you're beginning all that <em>again</em>. I
never <em>did</em> see such a cure as you are.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself, displeased</i>). I wish she could
bring herself to take me a little more seriously. I
can <em>not</em> consider it a compliment to be called a
"cure"&mdash;whatever that is.</p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>considering it time to interfere</i>). Come,
Mr. Undershell, all this whispering reelly is not fair
on the company! You mustn't hide your bushel
under a napkin like this; don't reserve <em>all</em> your
sparklers for Miss Phillipson there.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>stiffly</i>). I&mdash;ah&mdash;was not making any
remark that could be described as a sparkler, sir. I
<em>don't</em> sparkle.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>demurely</i>). He was being rather sentimental
just then, Mr. Steptoe, as it happens. Not
that he can't sparkle, when he likes. I'm sure if
you'd heard how he went on in the fly!</p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>with malice</i>). Not having been privileged
to be present, perhaps our friend here could recollect
a few of his happiest efforts and repeat them.</p>

<p><i>Miss Dolman.</i> Do, Mr. Undershell, please. I do
<em>love</em> a good laugh.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>crimson</i>). I&mdash;you really must excuse
me. I said nothing worth repeating. I don't
remember that I was particularly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Steptoe.</i> Pardon me. Afraid I was indiscreet. We
must spare Miss Phillipson's blushes by all manner
of means.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Oh, it was nothing of <em>that</em> sort, Mr.
Steptoe! <em>I</em>'ve no objection to repeat what he said.
He called me a little green something or other.
No; he said <em>that</em> in the train, though. But he would
have it that the old cab-horse was a magic steed,
and the fly an enchanted chariot; and I don't know
what all. (<i>As nobody smiles.</i>) It sounded awfully
funny as <em>he</em> said it, with his face perfectly solemn
like it is now, I assure you it did!</p>

<p><i>Steptoe</i> (<i>patronisingly</i>). I can readily believe it.
We shall have you contributing to some of our
yumerous periodicals, Mr. Undershell, sir, before long.
Such facetious talent is too good to be lost, it reelly is.</p>

for more sense. To make me publicly ridiculous
like this!</p>

<p><i>Miss Stickler</i> (<i>offering to rise</i>). It <em>does</em> seem to

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret</i> (<i>severely</i>). Stay where you are,

so wropped up in his cookery, he'd know there's

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> No, 'ang it <em>all</em>, mamsell, I 'ope there's

to see the Countess keeps as fit as ever, Miss Phillipson!
Wonderful woman for her time o' life! Law,
she <em>did</em> give the Bishop beans at dinner, and no
mistake!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Her ladyship is pretty generous with
them to most people, Mr. Tredwell. I'm sure I'd
have left her long ago, if it wasn't for Lady Maisie&mdash;who
<em>is</em> a lady, if you like!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> She don't favour her ma, I will say <em>that</em>
for her. By the way, who is the party they brought
down with them? a youngish looking chap&mdash;seemed
a bit out of his helement, when he first come in,
though he's soon got over that, judging by the way
him and your Lady Rhoda, Miss Dolman, was
'obnobbing together at table!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Nobody came down with <em>my</em> ladies;
they must have met him in the bus, I expect. What
is his name?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Why, he give it to me, I know, when I
enounced him; but it's gone clean out of my head
again. He's got the Verney Chamber, I know <em>that</em>
much; but what <em>was</em> his name again? I shall forget
my own next.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>involuntarily</i>). In the Verney Chamber?
Then the name must be Spurrell!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>starting</i>). Spurrell! Why, <em>I</em> used to&mdash;&mdash; But
of course it can't be <em>him</em>!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Spurrell <em>was</em> the name, though. (<i>With
a resentful glare at</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) I don't know how
<em>you</em> came to be aware of it, sir!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Why, the fact is, I happened to find
out that&mdash;(<i>here he receives an admonitory drive in the
back from the</i> Boy)&mdash;that his name <em>was</em> Spurrell.
(<i>To himself.</i>) I wish this infernal boy wouldn't be
officious&mdash;but perhaps he's right!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Ho, indeed! Well, <em>another</em> time, Mr.
Hundershell, if you require information about parties
staying with <em>us</em>, p'raps you'll be good enough to
apply to me pussonally, instead of picking it up in
some 'ole-and-corner fashion. (<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>controls
his indignation with difficulty</i>.) To return to the
individual in question, Miss Phillipson, I should
have said myself he was something in the artistic or

of being a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>to herself, relieved</i>). Then it <em>isn't</em> my
Jem! I might have known he wouldn't be visiting
here, and carrying on with Lady Rhodas. He'd
never forget himself like that&mdash;if he <em>has</em> forgotten me!</p>

<p><i>Steptoe.</i> It strikes me he's more of a sporting character,
Tredwell. I know when I was circulating
with the cigarettes and so on, in the hall just now,
he was telling the Captain some anecdote about an
old steeplechaser that was faked up to win a selling
handicap, and it tickled me to that extent I could
hardly hold the spirit-lamp steady.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> I may be mistook, Steptoe. All <em>I</em> can
say is, that when me and James was serving cawfy
to the ladies in the drawing-room, some of them had
got 'old of a little pink book all sprinkled over with
silver cutlets, and, rightly <em>or</em> wrongly, I took it to
'ave some connection with 'im.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). Pink and silver! Might I
ask&mdash;was it a volume of poetry, called&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>crushingly</i>). That I did not take the
liberty of inquiring, sir, as you might be aware if you
was a little more familiar with the hetiquette of good
society.</p>

I&mdash;I find I must go at once.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pomfret.</i> Well, Mr. Undershell, sir, you're
the best judge; and, if you really can't stop, this is
Mr. Adams, who'll take you round to the stables
himself, and do anything that's necessary. Won't
you, Mr. Adams?</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> So you're off to-night, sir, are you? Well,
I'd rather ha' shown you Deerfoot by daylight, myself;
but there, I dessay that won't make much difference
to <em>you</em>, so long as you <em>do</em> see the 'orse?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). So Deerfoot's a <em>horse</em>!
One of the features of Wyvern, I suppose; they seem
very anxious I shouldn't miss it. <em>I</em> don't want to
see the beast; but I dare say it won't take many
minutes; and, if I don't humour this man, I shan't
get a conveyance to go away in! (<i>Aloud.</i>) No difference
whatever&mdash;to <em>me</em>. I shall be delighted to be
shown Deerfoot; only I really can't wait <em>much</em>
longer; I&mdash;I've an appointment elsewhere!</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>Outside the Stables at Wyvern.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About</i> 10 <span class="smcap">P.M</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself, as he follows</i> <span class="smcap">Adams</span>). Now
is my time to arrange about getting away from here.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Adams</span>.) By the bye, I suppose you can let me
have a conveyance of some sort&mdash;after I've seen the
horse? I&mdash;I'm rather in a hurry.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You'd better speak to Mr. Checkley about
that, sir; it ain't in <em>my</em> department, you see. I'll
fetch him round, if you'll wait here a minute; he'd
like to hear what you think about the 'orse.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He goes off to the coachman's quarters.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>alone</i>). A very civil fellow this; he
seems quite anxious to show me this animal! There
must be <em>something</em> very remarkable about it.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<span class="smcap">Adams</span> <i>returns with</i> <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Mr. Checkley, our 'ed coachman, Mr.
Undershell. He's coming in along with us to 'ear
what you say, if you've no objections.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I must make a friend of
this coachman, or else&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) I shall be
charmed, Mr. Checkley. I've only a very few
minutes to spare; but I'm most curious to see this
horse of yours.</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> He ain't one o' <em>my</em> 'orses, sir. If he <em>'ad</em>
been&mdash;&mdash; But there, I'd better say nothing about it.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>as he leads the way into the stables, and
turns up the gas</i>). There, sir, that's Deerfoot over
there in the loose box.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). He seems to me much
like any <em>other</em> horse! However, I can't be wrong in
admiring. (<i>Aloud, as he inspects him, through the
rails.</i>) Ah, indeed? he <em>is</em> worth seeing! A magnificent
creature!</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>stripping off</i> Deerfoot's <i>clothing</i>). He's a
good 'orse, sir. Her ladyship won't trust herself on
no other animal, not since she 'ad the influenzy so
bad. She'd take on dreadful if I 'ad to tell her he
wouldn't be fit for no more work, she would!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). I can quite imagine
so. Not that he seems in any danger of <em>that</em>!</p>

<p><i>Checkley</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>). There, you 'ear that,
Adams? The minute he set eyes on the 'orse!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Wait till Mr. Undershell has seen him
move a bit, and see what he says <em>then</em>.</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> If it was what <em>you</em> think, he'd never be
standing like he is now, depend upon it.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You <em>can't</em> depend upon it. He 'eard us
coming, and he's quite artful enough to draw his foot
back for fear o' getting a knock. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.)
I've noticed him very fidgety-like on his forelegs
this last day or two.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> <em>Have</em> you, though? (<i>To himself.</i>) I
hope he won't be fidgety with his <em>hind</em>-legs. I shall
stay outside.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> I cooled him down with a rubub and
aloes ball, and kep 'im on low diet; but he don't
seem no better.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I didn't gather the horse
was unwell. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Dear me! no better? You
don't say so!</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> If you'd rubbed a little embrocation into
the shoulder, you'd ha' done more good, in <em>my</em>
opinion, and it's my belief as Mr. Undershell here
will tell you I'm right.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Can't afford to offend the
coachman! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, I dare say&mdash;er&mdash;embrocation
<em>would</em> have been better.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Ah, that's where me and Mr. Checkley
differ. According to me, it ain't to do with the
shoulder at all&mdash;it's a deal lower down.... I'll
'ave him out of the box and you'll soon see what
I mean.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Pray don't trouble on my
account. I&mdash;I can see him capitally from where
I am, thanks.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You know best, sir. Only I thought
you'd be better able to form a judgment after you'd
seen the way he stepped across. But if you was to
come in and examine the frog?&mdash; I don't like the
look of it myself.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm sure <em>I</em> don't. I've a
horror of reptiles. (<i>Aloud.</i>) You're very good. I&mdash;I
think I won't come in. The place must be rather
<em>damp</em>, mustn't it&mdash;for that?</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> It's dry enough in 'ere, sir, as you may
see; nor yet he ain't been standing about in no wet.
Still, there it <em>is</em>, you see!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). What a fool he must be
not to drive it out! Of course it must annoy the
horse. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I don't see it; but I'm quite
willing to take your word for it.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> I don't know how you can <em>expect</em> to see
it, sir, without you look inside of the 'oof for it.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's not alive&mdash;it's
something <em>inside</em> the hoof. I suppose I ought to
have known that. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Just so; but I see no
necessity for looking inside the hoof.</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> In course he don't, or he'd ha' looked
the very fust thing, with all his experience. I 'ope
you're satisfied <em>now</em>, Adams?</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> I can't say as I am. I say as no man
can examine a 'orse thoroughly at that distance, be
he who he may. And whether I'm right or wrong,
it 'ud be more of a satisfaction to me if Mr. Undershell
was to step in and see the 'oof for himself.</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> Well, there's sense in that, and I dessay
Mr. Undershell won't object to obliging you that far.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with reluctance</i>). Oh, with pleasure, if
you make a point of it.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He enters the loose box delicately.</i></p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>picking up one of the horse's feet</i>). Now,
tell me how this 'ere 'oof strikes you.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). That hoof <em>can't</em>; but I'm
not so sure about the others. (<i>Aloud, as he inspects
it.</i>) Well&mdash;er&mdash;it seems to me a very <em>nice</em> hoof.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>grimly</i>). I was not arsking your opinion
of it as a work of <em>art</em>, sir. Do you see any narrering
coming on, or do you not? That's what I should
like to get out of <em>you</em>!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Does this man suppose
I <em>collect</em> hoofs! However, I'm not going to commit
myself. (<i>Aloud.</i>) H'm&mdash;well, I&mdash;I rather agree
with Mr. Checkley.</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> I knew he would! Now you've <em>got</em> it,
Adams! <em>I</em> can see Mr. Undershell knows what he's
about.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>persistently</i>). But look at this 'ere pastern.
You can't deny there's puffiness there. How do you
get over <em>that</em>?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> If the horse is puffy, it's <em>his</em> business
to get over it&mdash;not mine.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>aggrieved</i>). You may think proper to treat
it light, sir; but if you put your 'and down 'ere,
above the coronet, you'll feel a throbbing as plain
as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Very likely. But I don't know, really,
that it would afford me any particular gratification
if I <em>did</em>!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> Well, if you don't take <em>my</em> view, I should
ha' thought as you'd want to feel the 'orse's pulse.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You are quite mistaken. I don't.
(<i>To himself.</i>) Particularly as I shouldn't know where
to find it. What a bore this fellow is with his horse!</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> In course, sir, <em>you</em> see what's running in
Mr. Adams's 'ed all this time, what he's a-driving
at, eh?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I only wish I did! This
will require tact. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I could hardly avoid
seeing <em>that</em>&mdash;could I?</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> <em>I</em> should think not. And it stands to
reason as a vet like yourself'd spot a thing like
navickler fust go off.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). A vet! They've been
taking me for a vet all this time! I can't have been
so ignorant as I thought. I really don't like to
undeceive them&mdash;they might feel annoyed. (<i>Aloud,
knowingly.</i>) To be sure, I&mdash;I spotted it at once.</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> He <em>does</em> make it out navicular after all!
What did I tell you, Checkley? Now p'raps you'll
believe <em>me</em>!</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> I'll be shot if that 'orse has navickler,
whoever says so&mdash;there!</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). It's the 'orse 'll 'ave to be shot;
worse luck! I'd ha' give something if Mr. Undershell
could ha' shown I was wrong; but there was
very little doubt in <em>my</em> mind what it was all along.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself, horrified</i>). I've been pronouncing
this unhappy animal's doom without knowing
it! I must tone it down. (<i>Aloud.</i>) No&mdash;no,
I never said he must be shot. There's no reason to
despair. It&mdash;it's quite a mild form of er&mdash;clavicular&mdash;not
at all infectious at present. And the horse
has a splendid constitution. I&mdash;I really think he'll
soon be himself again, if we only&mdash;er&mdash;leave Nature
to do her work, you know.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>after a prolonged whistle</i>). Well, if Nature
ain't better up in her work than you seem to be, it's
'igh time she chucked it, and took to something else.
You've a lot to learn about navicular, <em>you</em> 'ave, if
you can talk such rot as that!</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;YOU&#39;VE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT NAVICULAR, YOU &#39;AVE, IF YOU CAN TALK SUCH

</div>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> Ah, I've 'ad to do with a vet or two in
my time, but I'm blest if I ever come across the
likes o' <em>you</em> afore!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I <em>knew</em> they'd find me out!
I must pacify them. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But, look here, I'm
<em>not</em> a vet. I never said I <em>was</em>. It was your mistake
entirely. The fact is, my&mdash;my good men, I came
down here because&mdash;well, it's unnecessary to explain
now <em>why</em> I came. But I'm most anxious to get
away, and if you, my dear Mr. Checkley, could let
me have a trap to take me to Shuntingbridge to-night,
I should feel extremely obliged.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<span class="smcap">Checkley</span> <i>stares, deprived of speech</i>.</p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>with a private wink to</i> <span class="smcap">Checkley</span>). Certainly
he will, sir. I'm sure Checkley 'll feel proud
to turn out, late as it is, to oblige a gentleman with
your remarkable knowledge of 'orseflesh. Drive you
over hisself in the broom and pair, <em>I</em> shouldn't wonder!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> <em>One</em> horse will be quite sufficient.
Very well, then. I'll just run up and get my portmanteau,
and&mdash;and one or two things of mine, and
if you will be round at the back entrance&mdash;don't
trouble to drive up to the <em>front</em> door&mdash;as soon as
possible, I won't keep you waiting longer than I can
help. Good evening, Mr. Adams, and many thanks.
(<i>To himself, as he hurries back to the house.</i>) I've got
out of that rather well. Now, I've only to find my
way to the Verney Chamber, see this fellow Spurrell,
and get my clothes back, and then I can retreat with
comfort, and even dignity! These Culverins shall
learn that there is at least <em>one</em> poet who will not put
up with their insolent patronage!</p>

<p><i>Checkley</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adams</span>). He <em>has</em> got a cool cheek, and
no mistake! But if he waits to be druv over to
Shuntingbridge till <em>I</em> come round for him, he'll 'ave
to set on that portmanteau of his a goodish time!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> He did you pretty brown, I must say.
To 'ear you crowing over me when he was on your
side. I could 'ardly keep from larfing!</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> I see he warn't no vet long afore you,
but I let it go on for the joke of it. It was rich to
see you a-wanting him to feel the 'oof, and give it
out navickler. Well, you got his opinion for what
it was wuth, so <em>you're</em> all right!</p>

<p><i>Adams.</i> You think nobody knows anything about
'orses but yourself, you do; but if you're meanin' to
make a story out o' this against me, why, I shall
tell it <em>my</em> way, that's all!</p>

<p><i>Checkley.</i> It was you he made a fool of, not me&mdash;and
I can prove it&mdash;there!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>They dispute the point, with rising warmth,
for some time.</i></p>

<p><i>Adams</i> (<i>calming down</i>). Well, see 'ere, Checkley,
I dunno, come to think of it, as either on us 'll show
up partickler smart over this 'ere job; and it strikes
me we'd better both agree to keep quiet about it, eh?
(<span class="smcap">Checkley</span> <i>acquiesces, not unwillingly</i>.) And I think
I'll take a look in at the 'ousekeeper's-room presently,

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself, as he emerges from a back
staircase</i>). I suppose this <em>is</em> the corridor? The boy
said the name of the room was painted up over the
door.... Ah, there it is; and, yes, Mr. Spurrell's
name on a card.... The door is ajar; he is probably
waiting for me inside. I shall meet him quite
temperately, treat it simply as a&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He enters;
a waste-paper basket, containing an ingenious arrangement
of liquid and solid substances, descends on his
head.</i>) What the devil do you mean, sir, by this
outrageous&mdash;&mdash;? All dark! Nobody here! Is
there a general conspiracy to insult me? Have I
been lured up here for a brutal&mdash;&mdash; (<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>

dignity, through the lattice-work of the basket.</i>) Will
you kindly explain what this means?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Wait till I strike a light. (<i>After lighting
a pair of candles.</i>) Well, sir, if <em>you</em> don't know why
you're ramping about like that under a waste-paper
basket, I can hardly be expected to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I was determined not to remove it
until somebody came in; it fell on my head the
moment I entered; it contained something in a
soap-dish, which has wetted my face. You may
laugh, sir, but if this is a sample of your aristocratic&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> If you could only see yourself! But
<em>I</em>'d nothing to do with it, 'pon my word I hadn't;
only just this minute got away from the hall....
<em>I</em> know! It's that sulky young beggar, Bearpark.
I remember he slipped off on some excuse or other
just now. He must have come in here and fixed
that affair up for me&mdash;confound him!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I think <em>I</em>'m the person most entitled
to&mdash;&mdash; But no matter; it is merely one insult
more among so many. I came here, sir, for a
purpose, as you are aware.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>ruefully</i>). Your dress clothes? All
right, you shall have them directly. I wouldn't have
put 'em on if I'd known they'd be wanted so soon.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I should have thought your own
would have been more comfortable.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> More comfortable! I believe you.
Why, I assure you I feel like a Bath bun in a baby's
sock! But how was I to know? You shouldn't
leave your things about like that!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> It is usual, sir, for people to come to a
place like this provided with evening clothes of their
own.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I know that as well as you do. Don't
you suppose I'm unacquainted with the usages of
society! Why, I've stayed in boarding-houses at
the seaside many a time where it was <i>de rigger</i> to
dress&mdash;even for high tea! But coming down, as I
did, on business, it never entered my head that I
should want my dress suit. So, when I found them
all as chummy and friendly as possible, and expecting
me to dine as a matter of course,&mdash;why, I can
tell you I was too jolly glad to get hold of anything
in the shape of a swallowtail and white choker to be
over particular!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You seem to have been more fortunate
in your reception than I. But then <em>I</em> had not the
advantage of being here in a business capacity.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, it wasn't that altogether. You
see, I'm a kind of a celebrity in my way.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I should hardly have thought <em>that</em>
would be a recommendation here.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I was surprised myself to find what a
lot they thought of it; but, bless you, they're all as
civil as shopwalkers; and, as for the ladies, why, the
old Countess and Lady Maisie and Lady Rhoda
couldn't be more complimentary if I'd won the
Victoria Cross, instead of getting a first prize for
breeding and exhibiting a bull-bitch at Cruft's Dog
show!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>bitterly, to himself</i>). And this is our
aristocracy! They make a bosom friend of a breeder
of dogs; and find a poet only fit to associate with
their servants! What a theme for a satirist!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I see nothing to wonder at. You possess
precisely the social qualifications most likely to
appeal to the leisured class.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh, there's a lot of humbug in it, mind
you! Most of 'em know about as much of the
points of a bull as the points of a compass, only
they let on to know a lot because they think it's smart.
And some of 'em are after a pup from old Drummy's
next litter. <em>I</em> see through all that, you know!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You are a cynic, I observe, sir. But
possibly the nature of the business which brings you
here renders them&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> That's the rummest thing about it. I
haven't heard a word about that yet. I'm in the
veterinary profession, you know. Well, they sent
for me to see some blooming horse, and never even
ask me to go near it! Seems odd, don't it?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). <em>I</em> had to go near the
blooming horse! Now I begin to understand; the
very servants did not expect to find a professional
vet in any company but their own! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I
trust that the horse will not suffer through any delay.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> So do I; but how do I know that some
ignorant duffer mayn't be treating him for the wrong
thing? It may be all up with the animal before I
get a chance of seeing what I can do?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If he knew how near I
went to getting the poor beast shot! But I needn't
mention that now.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I don't say it isn't gratifying to be
treated like a swell, but I've got my professional
reputation to consider, you know; and if they're
going to take up all my time talking about
Andromeda&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with a start</i>). Andromeda! They
have been talking about Andromeda? To you!
Then it's <em>you</em> who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Haven't I been telling you? I should
just jolly well think they <em>have</em> been talking about
her! So you didn't know my bull's name was
Andromeda before, eh? But <em>you</em> seem to have
heard of her, too!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>slowly</i>). I&mdash;I <em>have</em> heard of Andromeda&mdash;yes.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He drops into a chair, dazed.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>complacently</i>). It's curious how that
bitch's fame seems to have spread. Why, even the
old Bishop&mdash;&mdash; But, I say, you're looking rather
queer; anything the matter with you, old fellow?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Nothing&mdash;nothing. I&mdash;I
feel a little giddy, that's all. I shall be better
presently.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He conceals his face.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>in concern</i>). It was having that basket
down on your head like that. Too bad! Here, I'll
get you some water. (<i>He bustles about.</i>) I don't
know if you're aware of it, old chap, but you're in a
regular <em>dooce</em> of a mess!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>motioning him away irritably</i>). Do
you suppose I don't know <em>that</em>? For Heaven's sake,
don't speak to me! let me alone!... I want to
think&mdash;I want to think. (<i>To himself.</i>) I see it all
now! I've made a hideous mistake! I thought
these Culverins were deliberately&mdash;&mdash; And all the
time&mdash;&mdash; Oh, what an unspeakable idiot I've been!...
And I can't even explain!... The only thing
to do is to escape before this fellow suspects the
truth. It's lucky I ordered that carriage! (<i>Aloud,
rising.</i>) I'm all right now; and&mdash;and I can't stay
here any longer. I am leaving directly&mdash;directly!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> You must give me time to get out of
this toggery, old chap; you'll have to pick me out of
it like a lobster!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>wildly</i>). The clothes? Never mind
them now. I can't wait. Keep them!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Do you really mean it, old fellow? If
you <em>could</em> spare 'em a bit longer, I'd be no end
obliged. Because, you see, I promised Lady Rhoda
to come and finish a talk we were having, and
they've taken away my own things to brush, so I
haven't a rag to go down in except these; and they'd
all think it so beastly rude if I went to bed now!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). I tell you you may keep
them, if you'll only go away!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> But where am I to send the things to
when I've done with 'em?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> What do I&mdash;&mdash; Stay, here's my card.
Send them to that address. Now go and finish your
evening!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>gratefully</i>). You <em>are</em> a rattling good chap,
and no mistake! Though I'm hanged if I can quite
make out what you're doing here, you know!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> It's not at all necessary that you
<em>should</em> make it out. I am leaving immediately, and&mdash;and
I don't wish Sir Rupert or Lady Culverin to
hear of this&mdash;you understand?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, it's no business of mine; you've
behaved devilish well to me, and I'm not surprised
that you'd rather not be seen in the state you're in.
I shouldn't like it myself!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> State? <em>What</em> state?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Ah, I <em>wondered</em> whether you knew.
You'll see what I mean when you've had a look at
yourself in the glass. I dare say it'll come off right
enough. I can't stop. Ta, ta, old fellow, and
thanks awfully!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>alone</i>). What does he mean? But
I've no time to waste. Where have they put my
portmanteau? I can't give up <em>everything</em>. (<i>He
hunts round the room, and eventually discovers a door
leading into a small dressing-room.</i>) Ah, it's in
there. I'll get it out, and put my things in. (<i>As he
rushes back, he suddenly comes face to face with his
own reflection in a cheval glass.</i>) Wh&mdash;who's that?
Can this&mdash;this piebald horror possibly be&mdash;<em>me</em>?
How&mdash;&mdash;? Ah, it was <em>ink</em> in that infernal basket&mdash;not
water! And my hair's full of flour! I <em>can't</em>
go into a hotel like this, they'd think I was an
escaped lunatic! (<i>He flies to a wash-hand stand,
and scrubs and sluices desperately, after which he
inspects the result in the mirror.</i>) It's not <em>nearly</em> off
yet! Will <em>anything</em> get rid of this streakiness?
(<i>He soaps and scrubs once more.</i>) And the flour's
caked in my hair now! I must brush it all out
before I am fit to be seen. (<i>He gradually, after
infinite toil, succeeds in making himself slightly more
presentable.</i>) Is the carriage waiting for me all this

<small>AN INTELLECTUAL PRIVILEGE</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Chinese Drawing-room.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About</i>
9.45 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mrs. Earwaker.</i> Yes, dear Lady Lullington, I've
always insisted on each of my girls adopting a
distinct line of her own, and the result has been <em>most</em>
satisfactory. Louisa, my eldest, is literary; she had
a little story accepted not long ago by <i>The Milky
Way</i>; then Maria is musical&mdash;practices regularly
three hours every day on her violin. Fanny has
become quite an expert in photography&mdash;kodaked
her father the other day in the act of trying a difficult
stroke at billiards; a back view&mdash;but <em>so</em> clever and
characteristic!</p>

<p><i>Lady Lullington</i> (<i>absently</i>). A back view? How
<em>nice</em>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Earwaker.</i> He was the only one of the family
who didn't recognize it at once. Then my youngest
Caroline&mdash;well, I must say that for a long time I was
quite in despair about Caroline. It really looked as
if there was no single thing that she had the slightest
bent or inclination for. So at last I thought she had
better take up religion, and make <em>that</em> her speciality.</p>

<p><i>Lady Lullington</i> (<i>languidly</i>). Religion! How <em>very</em>
nice!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Earwaker.</i> Well, I got her a <i>Christian Year</i>
and a covered basket, and quantities of tracts, and so
on; but, somehow, she didn't seem to get <em>on</em> with it.
So I let her give it up; and now she's gone in for
poker-etching instead.</p>

<p><i>Lady Lullington</i> (<i>by an act of unconscious cerebration</i>).
Poker-etching! How very, <em>very</em> nice!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>Her eyelids close gently.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Oh, but indeed, Lady Culverin, I
thought he was perfectly charmin': not a bit booky,
you know, but as clever as he can stick; knows more
about terriers than any man I ever met!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> So glad you found him agreeable,
my dear. I was half afraid he might strike you as&mdash;well,
just a little bit <em>common</em> in his way of talking.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> P'raps&mdash;but, after all, one can't
expect those sort of people to talk quite like we do
ourselves, <em>can</em> one?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Is that Mr. Spurrell you are finding
fault with, Albinia? It is curious that <em>you</em> should
be the one person here who&mdash;&mdash; I consider him a
very worthy and talented young man, and I shall
most certainly ask him to dinner&mdash;or <em>lunch</em>, at all
events&mdash;as soon as we return. I dare say Lady Rhoda
will not object to come and meet him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Rather not. <em>I</em>'ll come, like a shot!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I suppose it's very silly
of me to be so prejudiced. Nobody else seems to
mind him!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>crossing over to them</i>). Oh, Lady
Culverin, Lady Lullington has such a <em>delightful</em> idea&mdash;she's
just been saying how very, very nice it would
be if Mr. Spurrell could be persuaded to read some
of his poetry aloud to us presently. <em>Do</em> you think
it could be managed?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>in distress</i>). Really, my dear
Vivien, I&mdash;I don't know <em>what</em> to say. I fancy people
would so <em>much</em> rather talk&mdash;don't you think so,
Rohesia?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Probably they would, Albinia. It
is most unlikely that they would care to hear anything
more intellectual and instructive than the
sound of their own voices.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> I <em>told</em> Lady Lullington that I was
afraid you would think it a bore, Lady Cantire.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> You are perfectly mistaken, Miss
Spelwane. I flatter myself I am quite as capable of
appreciating a literary privilege as anybody here.
But I cannot answer for its being so acceptable to
the majority.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> No, it wouldn't do at all. And it
would be making this young man so <em>much</em> too
conspicuous.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> You are talking nonsense, my dear.
When you are fortunate enough to secure a celebrity
at Wyvern, you can't make him <em>too</em> conspicuous. I
never knew that Laura Lullington had any taste for
literature before, but there's something to be said for
her suggestion&mdash;if it can be carried out; it would at
least provide a welcome relief from the usual after-dinner
dullness of this sort of gathering.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> Then&mdash;would <em>you</em> ask him, Lady
Cantire?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I, my dear? You forget that <em>I</em>
am not hostess here. My sister-in-law is the proper
person to do that.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Indeed I couldn't. But perhaps,
Vivien, if you liked to suggest it to him, he
might&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> I'll try, dear Lady Culverin. And
if my poor little persuasions have no effect, I shall
fall back on Lady Cantire, and then he <em>can't</em> refuse.
I must go and tell dear Lady Lullington&mdash;she'll be
so pleased! (<i>To herself, as she skims away.</i>) I
generally <em>do</em> get my own way. But I mean him to
do it to please <em>Me</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I must say that girl is
very much improved in manner since I last saw
anything of her.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>a little later, to</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>).
Have you heard what a treat is in store for us?
That delightful Mr. Spurrell is going to give us a
reading or a recitation, or something, from his own
poems; at least Miss Spelwane is to ask him as
soon as the men come in. Only <em>I</em> should have
thought that he would be much more likely to
consent if <em>you</em> asked him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Would you? I'm sure I don't know
why.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>archly</i>). Oh, he took me in to
dinner, you know, and it's quite wonderful how
people confide in me, but I suppose they feel I can
be trusted. He mentioned a little fact, which gave
me the impression that a certain fair lady's wishes
would be supreme with him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). The wretch! He <em>has</em>
been boasting of my unfortunate letter! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Mr. Spurrell had no business to give you any
impression of the kind. And the mere fact that I&mdash;that
I happened to admire his verses&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> Exactly! Poets' heads are so
easily turned; and, as I said to Captain Thicknesse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Captain Thicknesse! You have been
talking about it&mdash;to <em>him</em>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> I'd no idea you would mind anybody
knowing, or I would never have dreamed of&mdash;&mdash;
I've such a perfect <em>horror</em> of gossip! It took me so
much by surprise, that I simply couldn't resist. But
I can easily tell Captain Thicknesse it was all a
mistake; <em>he</em> knows how fearfully inaccurate I
always am.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I would rather you said nothing
more about it, please; it is really not worth while
contradicting anything so utterly absurd. (<i>To herself.</i>)
That Gerald&mdash;Captain Thicknesse&mdash;of all
people, should know of my letter! And goodness
only knows what story she may have made out of it!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>to herself, as she moves away</i>). I've
been letting my tongue run away with me, as usual.
She's <em>not</em> the original of "Lady Grisoline," after all.
Perhaps he meant Vivien Spelwane&mdash;the description
was much more like <em>her</em>!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>who has just entered with some of the younger
men, to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span>). What <em>are</em> you doing with
these chairs? Why are we all to sit in a circle, like
Moore and Burgess people? You're <em>not</em> going to set
the poor dear Bishop down to play baby-games? How
perfectly barbarous of you!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> The chairs are being arranged for
something much more intellectual. We are going
to get Mr. Spurrell to read a poem to us, if you want
to know. I <em>told</em> you I should manage it.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> There's only one drawback to that highly
desirable arrangement. The songster has unostentatiously
retired to roost. So I'm afraid you'll have
to do without your poetry this evening&mdash;that is,
unless you care to avail yourself again of <em>my</em> services?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). It is too <em>mean</em> of you.
You must have told him!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He protests his innocence.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Archie, what's become of Mr. Spurrell?
I particularly want to ask him something.</p>

<p><i>Bearpark.</i> The poet? He nipped upstairs&mdash;as I
told you all along he meant to&mdash;to scribble some of
his democratic drivel, and (<i>with a suppressed grin</i>) I
don't <em>think</em> you'll see him again this evening.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself, as he enters</i>). She's
keepin' a chair next hers in the corner there for
somebody. Can it be for that poet chap?... (<i>He
meets</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie's</span> <i>eye suddenly</i>.) Great Scott! If
she means it for <em>me</em>!... I've half a mind not
to&mdash;&mdash; No, I shall be a fool if I lose such a chance!
(<i>He crosses, and drops into the vacant chair next hers.</i>)
I <em>may</em> sit here, mayn't I?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>simply</i>). I meant you to. We used
to be such good friends; it's a pity to have misunderstandings.
And&mdash;and I want to ask you what
that silly little Mrs. Chatteris has been telling you
at dinner about me.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Well, she was sayin'&mdash;and I
must say I don't understand it, after your tellin' me
you knew nothing about this Mr. Spurrell till this
afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> But I don't. And I&mdash;I <em>did</em> offer to
explain, but you said you weren't curious!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Didn't want you to tell me
anything that perhaps you'd rather not, don't you
know. Still, I <em>should</em> like to know how this poet
chap came to write a poem all about you, and call
it "Lady Grisoline," if he never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> But it's too ridiculous! How <em>could</em>
he? When he never saw me, so far as I know, in
all his life before!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> He told Mrs. Chatteris you
were the original of his "Lady Grisoline" anyway,
and really&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> He dared to tell her that? How
disgracefully impertinent of him. (<i>To herself.</i>) So
long as he hasn't talked about my letter, he may say
what he pleases!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> But what <em>was</em> it you were goin'
to explain to me? You said there was somethin'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It's no use; I'd sooner
die than tell him about that letter now! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I&mdash;I only wished you to understand that, whatever
I think about poetry&mdash;I detest poets!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Yes, as you say, Bishop, a truly
Augustan mode of recreation. Still, Mr. Spurrell
doesn't seem to have come in yet, so I shall have
time to hear anything you have to say in defence of
your opposition to Parish Councils.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I must say it's rather rough
luck on that poor devil. I get his dress suit, and all
<em>he</em> comes in for is my booby-trap! (<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>,
<i>wearing a holland blouse over her evening toilette,
approaches from the other end of the passage; he does
not recognise her until the moment of collision</i>.) Emma!!
It's never <em>you</em>! How do you come to be <em>here</em>?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Then it <em>was</em> my Jem after
all! (<i>Aloud, distantly.</i>) I'm here in attendance on
Lady Maisie Mull, being her maid. If I was at all
curious&mdash;which I'm not&mdash;I might ask you what
<em>you</em>'re doing in such a house as this; and in evening
dress, if you please!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I'm in evening dress, Emma, such as it
is (not that I've any right to find fault with it); but
I'm in evening dress (<i>with dignity</i>) because I've been
included in the dinner party here.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> You must have been getting on since
<em>I</em> knew you. Then you were studying to be a horse-doctor.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I <em>have</em> got on. I am now a qualified
M.R.C.V.S.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> And does that qualify you to dine with
bishops and countesses and baronets and the gentry,
like one of themselves?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I don't say it does, in itself. It was my
Andromeda that did the trick, Emma.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Andromeda? They were talking of that
downstairs. What made you take to scribbling, James?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Scribbling? how do you mean? My
handwriting's easy enough to read, as you ought to
know very well.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> You can't expect me to remember what
your writing's like; it's so long since I've seen it!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Come, I like that! When I wrote twice
to say I was sorry we'd fallen out; and never got a
word back!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> If you'd written to the addresses I
gave you abroad&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Then you <em>did</em> write; but none of the
letters reached me. I never even knew you'd <em>gone</em>
abroad. I wrote to the old place. And so did you,
I suppose, not knowing I'd moved my lodgings too,
so naturally&mdash;&mdash; But what does it all matter, so
long as we've met and it's all right between us?
Oh, my dear girl, if you only knew how I worried
myself, thinking you were&mdash;&mdash; Well, all that's over
now, isn't it?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He attempts to embrace her.</i></p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>repulsing him</i>). Not quite so fast,

You wouldn't be here like this if you hadn't done
<em>something</em> to distinguish yourself.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, I don't say I mayn't have got a
certain amount of what they call "kudosh," owing to
Andromeda. But what difference does that make?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Tell me, James, is it <em>you</em> that's been
writing a pink book all over silver cutlets?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Me? Write a book&mdash;about cutlets&mdash;or
anything else! Emma, you don't suppose I've quite
come down to that! Andromeda's the name of my
bull-dog. I took first prize with her; there were
portraits of both of us in one of the papers. And
the people here were very much taken with the dog,
and&mdash;and so they asked me to dine with them.
That's how it was.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> I should have thought, if they asked one
of you to dine, it ought to have been the bull-dog.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Now what's the good of saying extravagant
things of that sort? Not that old Drummy
couldn't be trusted to behave anywhere!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Better than her master, I dare say. <em>I</em>
heard of your goings on with some Lady Rhoda or
other!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Oh, the girl I sat next to at dinner? Nice
chatty sort of girl; seems fond of quadrupeds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Especially two-legged ones! You see,
I've been told all about it!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I assure you, I didn't go a step beyond
the most ordinary civility. You're not going to be
jealous because I promised I'd give her a liniment
for one of her dogs, are you?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Liniment! You always <em>were</em> a flirt,
James! But I'm not jealous. I've met a very
nice-spoken young man while I've been here; he sat
next to me at supper, and paid me the most beautiful
compliments, and was most polite and attentive&mdash;though
he hasn't got as far as liniment, at present.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> But, Emma, you're not going to take
up with some other fellow just when we've come
together again?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> If you call it "coming together," when
I'm down in the housekeeper's room, and you're up
above, carrying on with ladies of title!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Do you want to drive me frantic? As
if I could help being where I am! How could I
know <em>you</em> were here?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> At all events, you know <em>now</em>, James.
And it's for you to choose between your smart lady
friends and me. If you're fit company for them,
you're too grand for one of their maids.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> My dear girl, don't be unreasonable!
I'm expected back in the drawing-room, and I <em>can't</em>
throw 'em over now all of a sudden without giving
offence. There's the interests of the firm to consider,
and it's not for me to take a lower place than
I'm given. But it's only for a night or two, and
you don't really suppose I wouldn't rather be where
you are if I was free to choose&mdash;but I'm <em>not</em>, Emma,
that's the worst of it!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Well, go back to the drawing-room,
then; don't keep Lady Rhoda waiting for her liniment
on my account. I ought to be in my ladies'
rooms by this time. Only don't be surprised if, whenever
you <em>are</em> free to choose, you find you've come back
just too late&mdash;that's all!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She turns to leave him.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>detaining her</i>). Emma, I won't let you
go like this! Not before you've told me where I
can meet you again here.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> There's no place that I know of&mdash;except
the housekeeper's room; and of course you
couldn't descend so low as that.... James, there's
somebody coming! Let go my hand&mdash;do you want
to lose me my character!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>Steps and voices are heard at the other end of
the passage; she frees herself, and escapes.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>attempting to follow</i>). But, Emma, stop
one&mdash;&mdash; She's gone!... Confound it, there's the
butler and a page-boy coming! It's no use staying
up here any longer. (<i>To himself, as he goes downstairs.</i>)
It's downright <em>torture</em>&mdash;that's what it is!
To be tied by the leg in the drawing-room, doing the
civil to a lot of girls I don't care a blow about; and
to know that all the time some blarneying beggar
downstairs is doing his best to rob me of my Emma!
Flesh and blood can't stand it; and yet I'm blest if
I see any way out of it without offending 'em all
round.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> At last, Mr. Spurrell! We began
to think you meant to keep away altogether. Has
anybody told you <em>why</em> you've been waited for so
impatiently?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>looking round the circle of chairs apprehensively</i>).
No. Is it family prayers, or what? Er&mdash;are
they over?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> No, no; nothing of that sort.
Can't you <em>guess</em>? Mr. Spurrell, I'm going to be
very bold, and ask a great, <em>great</em> favour of you. I
don't know why they chose <em>me</em> to represent them; I
told Lady Lullington I was afraid my entreaties
would have no weight; but if you only would&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). They're at it again! How
many <em>more</em> of 'em want a pup! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Sorry to
be disobliging, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>joining her hands in supplication</i>).
Not if I <em>implore</em> you? Oh, Mr. Spurrell, I've quite
set my heart on hearing you read aloud to us. Are
you really cruel enough to refuse?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Read aloud! Is <em>that</em> what you want
me to do? But I'm no particular hand at it. I don't
know that I've ever read aloud&mdash;except a bit out of
the paper now and then&mdash;since I was a boy at school!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> <em>What's</em> that I hear? Mr. Spurrell
professing incapacity to read aloud? Sheer affectation!
Come, Mr. Spurrell, I am much mistaken if
you are wanting in the power to thrill all hearts
here. Think of us as instruments ready to respond
to your touch. Play upon us as you will; but don't
be so ungracious as to raise any further obstacles.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>resignedly</i>). Oh, very well, if I'm required
to read, <em>I'm</em> agreeable.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>Murmurs of satisfaction.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Hush, please, everybody! Mr.
Spurrell is going to read. My dear Bishop, if you

hear where you are? Where are you going to sit, Mr.
Spurrell? In the centre will be best. Will somebody
move that lamp a little, so as to give him more light?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, as he sits down</i>). I wonder
what we're supposed to be playing at! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Well, what am I to read, eh?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>placing an open copy of</i> "Andromeda"

volume in his hand, a painful silence ensues,
which no one has sufficient presence of mind to
break for several seconds</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Not Clarion Blair!
Not even a poet! I&mdash;I could <em>slap</em> him!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Poor dear Vivien! But if
people will insist on patting a strange poet, they
mustn't be surprised if they get a nasty bite!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He didn't write <i>Andromeda</i>!
Then he hasn't got my letter after all!
And I've been such a <em>brute</em> to the poor dear man!
<em>How</em> lucky I said nothing about it to Gerald!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). So he <em>ain't</em> the
bard!... Now I see why Maisie's been behavin'
so oddly all the evenin'; she spotted him, and didn't
like to speak out. Tried to give me a hint, though.
Well, I shall stay out my leave now!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I thought all along he
seemed too good a sort for a poet!</p>

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's all very well; but how
about that skit he went up to write on us? He <em>must</em>
be a poet of sorts.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brooke-Chatteris</i> (<i>to herself</i>). This is fearfully
puzzling. What made him say that about "Lady
Grisoline"?</p>

<p><i>The Bishop</i> (<i>to himself</i>). A crushing blow for the
Countess; but not unsalutary. I am distinctly
conscious of feeling more kindly disposed to that
young man. Now why?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He ponders.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Lullington</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I thought this young
man was going to read us some more of his poetry;
it's too tiresome of him to stop to tell us about his
bull-dog. As if anybody cared <em>what</em> he called it!</p>

<p><i>Lord Lullington</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Uncommonly awkward,
this! If I could catch Laura's eye&mdash;but I
suppose it would hardly be decent to go just yet.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Can Rohesia have
known this? What possible object could she have
had in&mdash;&mdash; And oh, dear, <em>how</em> disgusted Rupert
will be!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Seems a decent young
chap enough! Too bad of Rohesia to let him in for
this. I don't care a straw what he is&mdash;he's none
the worse for not being a poet.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to herself</i>). What <em>is</em> he maundering
about? It's utterly inconceivable that <em>I</em> should
have made any mistake. It's only too clear what
the cause is&mdash;<em>Claret</em>!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>aloud, good-humouredly</i>). Too bad of
you to try and spoof me like this before everybody,
Miss Spelwane! I don't know whose idea it was
to play me such a trick, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane</i> (<i>indistinctly</i>). Please understand
that nobody here had the <em>least</em> intention of playing
a trick upon you!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, if you say so, of course&mdash;&mdash; But
it looked rather like it, asking me to read when
I've about as much poetry in me as&mdash;as a pot hat!
Still, if I'm <em>wanted</em> to read aloud, I shall be happy
to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Indeed, <em>indeed</em>, Mr. Spurrell,
we couldn't think of troubling you any more
under the circumstances! (<i>In desperation.</i>) Vivien,
my dear, won't you <em>sing</em> something?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>The company echo the request with unusual
eagerness.</i></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself, during</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane's</span> <i>song</i>).
Wonder what's put them off being read to all of a
sudden? My elocution mayn't be first-class, exactly,
but still&mdash;&mdash; (<i>As his eye happens to rest on the binding
of the volume on his knee.</i>) Hullo! This cover's
pink, with silver things, not unlike cutlets, on it!
Didn't Emma ask me&mdash;&mdash;? By George, if it's <em>that</em>!
I may get down to the housekeeper's room, after
all! As soon as ever this squalling stops I'll find
out; I <em>can't</em> go on like this! (Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span> <i>leaves
the piano; everybody plunges feverishly into conversation
on the first subject&mdash;other than poetry or dogs&mdash;that
presents itself, until</i> Lord <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Lullington</span> <i>set
a welcome example of departure</i>.) Better wait till
these county nobs have cleared, I suppose&mdash;there
goes the last of 'em&mdash;now for it!... (<i>He pulls
himself together, and approaches his host and hostess.</i>)
Hem, Sir Rupert, and your ladyship, it's occurred
to me that it's just barely possible you may have
got it in your heads that I was something in the
<em>poetical</em> way.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Not this poor young chap's
fault; must let him down as easily as possible!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Not at all&mdash;not at all! Ha&mdash;assure you
we quite understand; no necessity to say another
word about it.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Just my luck! They quite
understand! No housekeeper's room for me this
journey! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Of course I knew the Countess,
there, and Lady Maisie, were fully aware all
along&mdash;&mdash; (<i>To</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, <i>as stifled exclamations
reach his ear</i>.) You <em>were</em>, weren't you?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Yes, yes, Mr. Spurrell. Of
course! It's all <em>perfectly</em> right!</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to the others</i>). You see, I should never
have thought of coming in as a visitor if it hadn't
been for the Countess; she would <em>have</em> it that it
was all right, and that I needn't be afraid I shouldn't
be welcome.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> To be sure&mdash;any friend of my
sister-in-law's&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Albinia, I have refrained from
speech as long as possible; but this is really <em>too</em>
much! You <em>don't</em> suppose I should have introduced
Mr. Spurrell here unless I had had the strongest
reasons for knowing, however he may be pleased
to mystify us now, that he, and nobody else, is the
author of <i>Andromeda</i>! And I, for one, absolutely
decline to believe in this preposterous story of his
about a bull-dog.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> But your ladyship must have known!
Why, you as good as asked me on the way here
to put you down for a bull-pup!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Never, never! A bull-pup is the
last creature I should ever dream of coveting. You
were obliging enough to ask me to accept a presentation
copy of your verses.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Was I? I don't exactly see how I <em>could</em>
have been, considering I never made a rhyme in my
life!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> There, there, Rohesia, it was <em>your</em>
mistake; but as we are indebted to it for the
pleasure of making Mr. Spurrell's acquaintance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I am not in the habit of making
mistakes, Rupert. I don't know what you and
Albinia and Maisie may know that I am in ignorance
of, but, since you seem to have been aware
from the first that Mr. Spurrell was not the poet
you had invited here to meet me, will you kindly
explain what has become of the <em>real</em> author?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> My dear Rohesia, I don't know and I
don't <em>care</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> There you are <em>wrong</em>, Rupert,
because it's obvious that if he is not Mr. Spurrell,
the real poet's absence has to be accounted for in
<em>some</em> way.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> By Jove, I believe I can put you on the
track. I shouldn't wonder if he's the party these
dress clothes of mine belong to! I dare say you may
have noticed they don't look as if they were made
for me?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>closing her eyes</i>). Pray let us avoid
any sartorial questions! We are waiting to hear
about this person.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, I found I'd got on his things by
mistake, and I went up as soon as I could after
dessert to my room to take 'em off, and there he was,
with a waste-paper basket on his head&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> A waste-paper basket on his head!
And pray what should he have <em>that</em> for?</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> I'm no wiser than your ladyship <em>there</em>.
All <em>I</em> know is he said he wouldn't take it off till he
saw me. And I never saw any one in such a mess
with ink and flour as he was!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Ink and flour, indeed! This rigmarole
gets more ridiculous every moment! You
can't seriously expect any one here to believe it!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<span class="smcap">Archie</span> <i>discreetly retires to the smoking-room</i>.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell.</i> Well, I rather think somebody must
have fixed up a booby-trap for <em>me</em>, you know, and
he happened to go in first and get the benefit of it.
And he was riled, very naturally, thinking <em>I</em>'d done
it, but after we'd had a little talk together, he calmed
down and said I might keep his clothes, which I
thought uncommonly good-natured of him, you know.
By the way, he gave me his card. Here it is, if

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). But you wired me to come, sir!
About a horse of yours! I've been wondering all

what's occurred, it would probably be more satisfactory
to all parties if I shifted my quarters, and&mdash;took
my meals in the housekeeper's room.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> <i>utter inarticulate
protests</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> My <em>dear</em> sir, not on any account&mdash;couldn't
<em>hear</em> of it! My wife, I'm sure, will say the same.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>with an effort</i>). I hope Mr. Spurrell
will continue to be our guest precisely as before&mdash;that
is, if he will forgive us for putting him into another
room.</p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's no use; I <em>can't</em> get rid
of 'em; they stick to me like a lot of blooming burrs!
(<i>Aloud, in despair.</i>) Your ladyship is very good,
but&mdash;&mdash; Well, the fact is, I've only just found out
that a young lady I've long been deeply attached to
is in this very house. She's a Miss Emma Phillipson&mdash;maid,
so I understand, to Lady Maisie&mdash;and,
without for one moment wishing to draw any comparisons,
or to seem ungrateful for all the friendliness
I've received, I really and truly would feel myself
more comfortable in a circle where I could enjoy
rather more of my Emma's society than I can here!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>immensely relieved</i>). Perfectly natural!
and&mdash;hum&mdash;sorry as we are to lose you, Mr. Spurrell,
we&mdash;ah&mdash;mustn't be inconsiderate enough to
keep you here a moment longer. I've no doubt you
will find the young lady in the housekeeper's room&mdash;any
one will tell you where it is.... Good night
to you, then; and, remember, we shall expect to see
you in the field on Tuesday.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Good night, Mr. Spurrell, and&mdash;and
I'm so very glad&mdash;about Emma, you know. I hope
you will both be very happy.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She shakes hands warmly.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> So do I. And mind you don't
forget about that liniment, you know.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Maisie don't care
a hang! And I was ass enough to fancy&mdash;&mdash; But
there, that's all over now!</p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In the Verney Chamber.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>in the dressing-room, to himself</i>). I
wonder how long I've been locked up here&mdash;it seems
hours! I almost hope they've forgotten me altogether....
Some one has come in.... If it should
be Sir Rupert!! Great heavens, what a situation
to be found in by one's host!... Perhaps it's only
that fellow Spurrell; if so, there's a chance. (<i>The
door is unlocked by</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>, <i>who has lighted the
candles on the dressing table</i>.) It's the butler again.
Well, I shall soon know the worst! (<i>He steps out,
blinking, with as much dignity as possible.</i>) Perhaps
you will kindly inform me why I have been subjected
to this indignity?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>in perturbation</i>). I think, Mr. Undershell,
sir, in common fairness, you'll admit as you've mainly
yourself to thank for any mistakes that have occurred;
for which I 'asten to express my pussonal regret.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> So long as you realise that you have
made a mistake, I am willing to overlook it, on
condition that you help me to get away from this
place without your master and mistress's knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> It's too late, sir. They know you're 'ere!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> They know! Then there's no time to
be lost. I must leave this moment!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> No, sir, excuse me; but you can't hardly
do that <em>now</em>. I was to say that Sir Rupert and the
ladies would be glad to see you in the droring-room
himmediate.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Man alive! do you imagine anything
would induce me to meet them now, after the humiliations
I have been compelled to suffer under this roof?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> If you would prefer anything that has
taken place in the room, sir, or in the stables to be
'ushed up&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Prefer it! If it were only possible!
But they know&mdash;they <em>know</em>! What's the use of
talking like that?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I know where I am now!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) They know nothink up to the present, Mr.
Undershell, nor yet I see no occasion why they
should&mdash;leastwise from any of <em>Us</em>.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> But they know I'm here; how am I
to account for all the time&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> Excuse me, sir. I thought of that, and
it occurred to me as it might be more agreeable to
your feelings, sir, if I conveyed an impression that you
had only just arrived&mdash;'aving missed your train, sir.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>overjoyed</i>). How am I to thank you?
that was really most discreet of you&mdash;most considerate!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> I am truly rejoiced to hear you say so,
sir. And I'll take care nothing leaks out. And if
you'll be kind enough to follow me to the droring-room,
the ladies are waiting to see you.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I may actually meet Lady
Maisie Mull after all! (<i>Aloud, recollecting his condition.</i>)
But I can't go down like this. I'm in such
a horrible mess!</p>

<p><i>Tredwell.</i> I reelly don't perceive it, sir; except a
little white on your coat-collar behind. Allow me&mdash;there
it's off now. (<i>He gives him a hand-glass</i>) If
you'd like to see for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself as he looks</i>). A slight pallor,
that's all. I am more presentable than I could have
hoped. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Have the kindness to take me to
Lady Culverin at once.</p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In the Chinese Drawing-room. A few minutes later.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>, <i>after the introductions
have been gone through</i>). And so you missed the 4.55
and had to come on by the 7.30 which stops everywhere,
eh?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> It&mdash;it certainly does stop at most
stations.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> And how did you get on to Wyvern&mdash;been
here long?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> N&mdash;not <em>particularly</em> long.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Fact is, you see, we made a mistake.
Very ridiculous, but we've been taking that young
fellow, Mr. Spurrell, for <em>you</em> all this time; so we
never thought of inquiring whether you'd come or
not. It was only just now he told us how he'd met
you in the Verney Chamber, and the very handsome
way, if you will allow me to say so, in which you
had tried to efface yourself.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I didn't expect him to take
<em>that</em> view of it! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I felt I had no alternative.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>regards him with admiration</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> You did an uncommon fine thing, sir,
and I'm afraid you received treatment on your
arrival which you had every right to resent.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I hoped he didn't know
about the housekeeper's room! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Please
say no more about it, Sir Rupert. I know now that
you were entirely innocent of any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>horrified</i>). Good Gad! you didn't
suppose <em>I</em> had any hand in fixing up that booby-trap,
or whatever it was, did you? Young fellows
will get bear-fighting and playing idiotic tricks on
one another, and you seem to have been the victim&mdash;that's
how it was. Have you had anything to eat
since you came? If not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Thank you, I&mdash;I <em>have</em> dined.
(<i>To himself.</i>) So he <em>doesn't</em> know where, after all!
I will spare him <em>that</em>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Got some food at Shuntingbridge, eh?
Afraid they gave you a wretched dinner?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Quite the reverse, I assure you. (<i>To
himself.</i>) Considering that it came from his own table!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I <em>still</em> don't understand how
his clothes&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) Did you send your portmanteau
on ahead, then, or what?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>blankly</i>). Send my port&mdash;? I don't
understand.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Oh, I only asked, because the other man
said he was wearing your things.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>remains speechless</i>). I
see how it was&mdash;perfectly simple&mdash;rush for the train&mdash;porter
put your luggage in&mdash;you got left behind,
wasn't that it?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I&mdash;I certainly <em>did</em> get separated from
my portmanteau, somehow, and I suppose it must
have arrived before me. (<i>To himself.</i>) Considering
the pace of the fly-horse, I think I am justified in
assuming <em>that</em>!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Ass I was not to hold my tongue!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>in an undertone, to</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>).
Gerald, you remember what I said some
time ago&mdash;about poetry and poets?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Perfectly. And I thought
you were quite right.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I was quite <em>wrong</em>. I didn't know
what I was talking about. I do now. Good night.
(<i>She crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) Good night, Mr. Blair,
I'm so very glad we have met&mdash;at last!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She goes.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself, rapturously</i>). She's <em>not</em>
freckled; she's not even sandy. She's lovely! And,
by some unhoped-for good fortune, all this has
only raised me in her eyes. I am more than
compensated!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I may just as well
get back to Aldershot to-morrow&mdash;<em>now</em>. I'll go and
prepare Lady C.'s mind, in case. It's hard luck;
just when everything seemed goin' right! I'd give
somethin' to have the other bard back, I know. It's
no earthly use my tryin' to stand against <em>this</em> one!</p>

<small>DIFFERENT PERSONS HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Lady Maisie's</span> <i>Room at Wyvern</i>. <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday
night, about</i> 11.30.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>who is brushing her hair</i>).
You are <em>sure</em> mamma isn't expecting me? (<i>Irresolutely.</i>)
Perhaps I had better just run in and say good night.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> I wouldn't recommend it, really, my
lady; her ladyship seems a little upset in her nerves
this evening.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il-y-a de quoi!</i> (<i>Aloud, relieved.</i>)
It might only disturb her, certainly.... I hope
they are making you comfortable here, Phillipson?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Very much so indeed, thank you, my
lady. The tone of the room downstairs is <em>most</em> superior.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> <em>That's</em> satisfactory. And I hear
you have met an old admirer of yours here&mdash;Mr.
Spurrell, I mean.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> We <em>did</em> happen to encounter each other
in one of the galleries, my lady, just for a minute;
though I shouldn't have expected <em>him</em> to allude to it!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Indeed! And why not?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> Mr. James Spurrell appears to have
elevated himself to a very different sphere from what
he occupied when <em>I</em> used to know him, my lady;
though how and why he comes to be where he is, I
don't rightly understand myself at present.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). And no wonder! I feel
horribly guilty! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You mustn't blame poor
Mr. Spurrell, Phillipson; <em>he</em> couldn't help it!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>with studied indifference</i>). I'm not
blaming him, my lady. If he prefers the society
of his superiors to mine, he's very welcome to do so;
there's others only too willing to take his place!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Surely none who would be as fond
of you or make so good a husband, Phillipson!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> That's as maybe, my lady. There was
one young man that travelled down in the same
compartment, and sat next me at supper in the room.
I could see he took a great fancy to me from the
first, and his attentions were really quite pointed. I
am sure I couldn't bring myself to repeat his remarks,
they were so flattering!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Don't you think you will be rather
a foolish girl if you allow a few idle compliments
from a stranger to outweigh such an attachment as
Mr. Spurrell seems to have for you?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> If <em>he</em>'s found new friends, my lady, I
consider myself free to act similarly.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Then you don't know? He told us
quite frankly this evening that he had only just
discovered you were here, and would much prefer to
be where you were. He went down to the housekeeper's
room on purpose.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>moved</i>). It's the first I've heard of it,
my lady. It must have been after I came up. If
I'd only known he'd behave like <em>that</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>instructively</i>). You see how loyal he
is to <em>you</em>. And now, I suppose, he will find he has
been supplanted by this new acquaintance&mdash;some
smooth-tongued, good-for-nothing valet, I dare say?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>injured</i>). Oh, my lady, indeed he wasn't
a <em>man</em>! But there was nothing serious between us&mdash;at
least, on <em>my</em> side&mdash;though he certainly did go
on in a very sentimental way himself. However,
he's left the Court by now, that's <em>one</em> comfort! (<i>To
herself.</i>) I wish now I'd said nothing about him to
Jem. If he was to get asking questions downstairs&mdash;&mdash;
He always <em>was</em> given to jealousy&mdash;reason
or none!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>A tap is heard at the door.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>outside</i>). Maisie, may I come in? if
you've done your hair, and sent away your maid.
(<i>She enters.</i>) Ah, I see you haven't.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Don't run away, Rhoda; my maid
has just done. You can go now, Phillipson.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>to herself, as she sits down</i>). Phillipson!
So <em>that's</em> the young woman that funny vet
man prefers to <em>us</em>! H'm, can't say I feel flattered!</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>to herself, as she leaves the room</i>). This
must be the Lady Rhoda, who was making up to my
Jem! He wouldn't have anything to say to her,
though; and, now I see her, I am not surprised at it!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She goes. A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>crossing her feet on the fender</i>). Well,
we can't complain of havin' had a dull evenin', <em>can</em> we?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/p208.jpg" width="412" height="600" alt="&quot;WELL, WE CAN&#39;T COMPLAIN OF HAVIN&#39; HAD A DULL EVENIN&#39;, CAN WE?&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;WELL, WE CAN&#39;T COMPLAIN OF HAVIN&#39; HAD A DULL EVENIN&#39;, CAN WE?&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>taking a hand-screen from the mantelshelf</i>).
Not altogether. Has&mdash;anything fresh happened
since I left?</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Nothing particular. Archie apologised
to this new man in the billiard-room. For
the booby trap. We all told him he'd <em>got</em> to. And
Mr. Carrion Bear, or Blundershell, or whatever he
calls himself&mdash;<em>you</em> know&mdash;was so awf'lly gracious
and condescendin' that I really thought poor dear
old Archie would have wound up his apology by
punchin' his head for him. Strikes me, Maisie, that
mop-headed minstrel boy is a decided change for the
worse. Doesn't it you?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>toying with the screen</i>). How do you
<em>mean</em>, Rhoda?</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> I meantersay I call Mr. Spurrell&mdash;&mdash;
Well, he's real, anyway&mdash;he's a <em>man</em>, don't you know.
As for the other, so <em>feeble</em> of him missin' his train
like he did, and turnin' up too late for everything!
Now, <em>wasn't</em> it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Poets <em>are</em> dreamy and unpractical
and unpunctual&mdash;it's their nature.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Then they should stay at home.
Just see what a hopeless muddle he's got us all into!
I declare I feel as if anybody might turn into somebody
else on the smallest provocation after this. I
<em>know</em> poor Vivien Spelwane will be worryin' her
pillows like rats most of the night, and I rather
fancy it will be a close time for poets with your
dear mother, Maisie, for some time to come. All
this silly little man's fault!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> No, Rhoda. Not his&mdash;<em>ours</em>. Mine
and mamma's. We ought to have felt from the first
that there <em>must</em> be some mistake, that poor Mr.
Spurrell couldn't <em>possibly</em> be a poet! I don't know,
though&mdash;people generally <em>are</em> unlike what you'd expect
from their books. I believe they do it on purpose!
Not that that applies to Mr. Blair; he <em>is</em> one's idea
of what a poet should be. If he hadn't arrived when
he did, I don't think I could ever have borne to read
another line of poetry as long as I lived!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> I <em>say</em>! Do you call him as good-lookin'
as all <em>that</em>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I was not thinking about his looks,
Rhoda&mdash;it's his <em>conduct</em> that's so splendid.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> His conduct? Don't see anything
splendid in missin' a train. I could do it myself if
I tried.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Well, I wish I could think there
were many men capable of acting so nobly and
generously as he did.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> As how?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You really don't see! Well, then, you
<em>shall</em>. He arrives late, and finds that somebody else
is here already in his character. He makes no fuss;
manages to get a private interview with the person
who is passing as himself; when, of course, he soon
discovers that poor Mr. Spurrell is as much deceived
as anybody else. What is he to do? Humiliate
the unfortunate man by letting him know the truth?
Mortify my uncle and aunt by a public explanation
before a whole dinner-party? That is what a stupid
or a selfish man might have done, almost without
thinking. But not Mr. Blair. He has too much tact,
too much imagination, too much chivalry for that. He
saw at once that his only course was to spare his host
and hostess, and&mdash;and all of us a scene, by slipping
away quietly and unostentatiously, as he had come.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>yawning</i>). If he saw all that, why
didn't he <em>do</em> it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Why? How provoking
you can be, Rhoda! <em>Why?</em> Because that
stupid Tredwell wouldn't let him! Because Archie
delayed him by some idiotic practical joke! Because
Mr. Spurrell went and blurted it all out!... Oh,
don't try to run down a really fine act like that;
because you can't&mdash;you simply <em>can't</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>after a low whistle</i>). No idea it had
gone so far as that&mdash;already! <em>Now</em> I begin to see
why Gerry Thicknesse has been lookin' as if he'd sat
on his best hat, and why he told your aunt he might
have to be off to-morrow; which is all stuff, because
I happen to know his leave ain't up for two or three
days yet. But he sees this Troubadour has put his
poor old nose out of joint for him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>flushing</i>). Now, Rhoda, I won't have
you talking as if&mdash;as if&mdash;&mdash; <em>You</em> ought to know, if
Gerald Thicknesse doesn't, that it's nothing at all of
that sort! It's just&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I can't <em>tell</em> you how
some of his poems moved me, what new ideas, wider
views they seemed to teach; and then how <em>dreadfully</em>
it hurt to think it was only Mr. Spurrell after
all!... But <em>now</em>&mdash;oh, the <em>relief</em> of finding they're
not spoilt; that I can still admire, still look up to
the man who wrote them! Not to have to feel that
he is quite commonplace&mdash;not even a gentleman&mdash;in
the ordinary sense!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>rising</i>). Ah well, I prefer a hero who
looks as if he had his hair cut, occasionally&mdash;but
then, I'm not romantic. He may be the paragon
you say; but if I was you, my dear, I wouldn't expect
too much of that young man&mdash;allow a margin for
shrinkage, don't you know. And now I think I'll turn
into my little crib, for I'm dead tired. Good night;
don't sit up late readin' poetry; it's my opinion
you've read quite enough as it is!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She goes.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>alone, as she gazes dreamily into the
fire</i>). She doesn't in the <em>least</em> understand! She
actually suspects me of&mdash;&mdash; As if I could possibly&mdash;or
as if mamma would ever&mdash;even if <em>he</em>&mdash;&mdash; Oh,

haven't had to give up my ideal. I <em>should</em> like to
know him better. What harm is there in that?
And if Gerald chooses to go to-morrow, he must&mdash;that's
all. He isn't nearly so nice as he used to be;
and he has even <em>less</em> imagination than ever! I don't
think I <em>could</em> care for anybody so absolutely matter-of-fact.
And yet, only an hour ago I almost&mdash;&mdash; But

<small>THE FEELINGS OF A MOTHER.</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Morning Room.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Sunday morning;
just after breakfast.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>outside, to</i> <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span>). Dogcart
round, eh? everything in? All right&mdash;shan't
be a minute. (<i>Entering.</i>) Hallo, Pilliner, you all
alone here? (<i>He looks round disconcertedly.</i>) Don't
happen to have seen Lady Maisie about?</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Let me see&mdash;she <em>was</em> here a little while
ago, I fancy.... Why? Do you want her?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> No&mdash;only to say good-bye and
that. I'm just off.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Off? To-day! You don't mean to tell
me your chief is such an inconsiderate old ruffian as
to expect you to travel back to your Tommies on the
Sabbath! You could wait till to-morrow if you
<em>wanted</em> to. Come now!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Perhaps&mdash;only, you see, I
<em>don't</em> want to.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Well, tastes differ. I shouldn't call a
cross-country journey in a slow train, with unlimited
opportunities of studying the company's bye-laws
and traffic arrangements at several admirably ventilated
junctions, the ideal method of spending a
cheery Sunday, myself, that's all.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). Dare say it will be
about as cheery as stoppin' on here, if it comes to
that.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> I admit we were most of us a wee bit
chippy at breakfast. The bard conversed&mdash;I will
say <em>that</em> for him&mdash;but he seemed to diffuse a gloom
somehow. Shut you up once or twice in a manner
that might almost be described as damned offensive.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Don't know what you all saw
in what he said that was so amusin'. Confounded
rude <em>I</em> thought it!</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Don't think anyone <em>was</em> amused&mdash;unless
it was Lady Maisie. By the way, he might perhaps
have selected a happier topic to hold forth to Sir
Rupert on than the scandalous indifference of large
landowners to the condition of the rural labourer.
Poor dear old boy, he stood it wonderfully, considering.
Pity Lady Cantire breakfasted upstairs;
she'd have enjoyed herself. However, he had a very
good audience in little Lady Maisie.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> I do hate a chap that jaws at
breakfast.... <em>Where</em> did you say she was?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie's voice</i> (<i>outside, in conservatory</i>). Yes,
you really ought to see the orangery and the Elizabethan
garden, Mr. Blair. If you will be on the
terrace in about five minutes, I could take you round
myself. I must go and see if I can get the keys first.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> If you want to say good-bye, old fellow,
now's your chance!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> It&mdash;it don't matter. She's
engaged. And, look here, you needn't mention that
I was askin' for her.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> Of course, old fellow, if you'd rather not.
(<i>He glances at him.</i>) But I say, my dear old chap,
if <em>that's</em> how it is with you, I don't quite see the
sense of chucking it up <em>already</em>, don't you know.

manage to stay on, I would, if I were <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Hang it all, Pilliner, do you
suppose <em>I</em> don't know when the game's up! If it
was any <em>good</em> stayin' on&mdash;&mdash; And besides, I've said
good-bye to Lady C., and all that. No, it's too late
now.</p>

<p><i>Tredwell</i> (<i>at the door</i>). Excuse me, sir, but if
you're going by the 10.40, you haven't any too much
time.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to himself after</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span> <i>has

Pity he's not Lady Maisie's sort. Though what she

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Nonsense, my dear, no walk at all;
the church is only just across the park. My brother
Rupert always goes, and it pleases him to see the
Wyvern pew as full as possible. I seldom feel
equal to going myself, because I find the necessity of
allowing pulpit inaccuracies to pass without a protest
gets too much on my nerves; but my daughter will
accompany you. You'll have just time to run up
and get your things on.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>with arch significance</i>). I don't
<em>fancy</em> I shall have the pleasure of your daughter's
society this morning. I just met her going to get
the garden keys; I think she has promised to show
the grounds to&mdash;&mdash; Well, I needn't mention <em>whom</em>.
Oh dear me, I hope I'm not being indiscreet <em>again</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I make a point of never interfering
with my daughter's proceedings, and you can easily
understand how natural it is that such old friends as
they have always been&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> Really? I <em>thought</em> they seemed
to take a great pleasure in one another's society.
It's quite romantic. But I must rush up and get
my bonnet on if I'm to go to church. (<i>To herself, as
she goes out.</i>) So she <em>was</em> "Lady Grisoline," after
all! If I was her mother&mdash;&mdash; But dear Lady
Cantire is so advanced about things.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Darling Maisie! He'll
be Lord Dunderhead before very long. How sensible
and sweet of her! And I was quite uneasy about
them last night at dinner; they scarcely seemed to
be talking to each other at all. But there's a great
deal more in dear Maisie than one would imagine.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>outside</i>). We're rather proud of our
church, Mr. Undershell&mdash;fine old monuments and
brasses, if you care about that sort of thing. Some
of us will be walking over to service presently, if
you would like to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>outside&mdash;to himself</i>). And lose my
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> with Lady Maisie! Not exactly! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I am afraid, Sir Rupert, that I cannot conscientiously&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>hastily</i>). Oh, very well, very well;
do exactly as you like about it, of course. I only
thought&mdash;&mdash; (<i>To himself.</i>) Now, that <em>other</em> young
chap would have gone!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Rupert, who is that you are talking
to out there? I don't recognise his voice, somehow.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>entering with</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>). Ha,
Rohesia, you've come down, then? slept well, I
hope. I was talking to a gentleman whose acquaintance
I know you will be very happy to make&mdash;at
last. This is the genuine celebrity <em>this</em> time. (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) Let me make you known to my
sister, Lady Cantire, Mr. Undershell. (<i>As</i> Lady
<span class="smcap">Cantire</span> <i>glares interrogatively</i>.) Mr. Clarion Blair,
Rohesia, author of hum&mdash;ha&mdash;<i>Andromache</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I thought we were given to understand
last night that Mr. Spurrell&mdash;Mr. Blair&mdash;you
must pardon me, but it's really so very confusing&mdash;that
the writer of the&mdash;ah&mdash;volume in question had
already left Wyvern.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Well, my dear, you see he is still
here&mdash;er&mdash;fortunately for us. If you'll excuse me,
I'll leave Mr. Blair to entertain you; got to speak
to Adams about something.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He hurries out.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This must be Lady
Maisie's mamma. Better be civil to her, I suppose;
but I can't stay here and entertain her long!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Lady Cantire, I&mdash;er&mdash;have an appointment
for which I am already a little late; but
before I go, I should like to tell you how much
pleasure it has given me to know that my poor
verse has won your approval; appreciation from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> I'm afraid you must have been
misinformed, Mr.&mdash;a&mdash;Blair. There are so many
serious publications claiming attention in these days
of literary over-production that I have long made it
a rule to read no literature of a lighter order that has
not been before the world for at least ten years. I
may be mistaken, but I infer from your appearance
that your own work must be of a considerably more
recent date.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If she imagines she's
going to snub Me&mdash;&mdash;! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Then I was
evidently mistaken in gathering from some expressions
in your daughter's letter that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Entirely. You are probably thinking
of some totally different person, as my daughter
has never mentioned having written to you, and is
not in the habit of conducting <em>any</em> correspondence
without my full knowledge and approval. I think
you said you had some appointment; if so, pray don't
consider yourself under any necessity to remain here.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You are very good; I will not. (<i>To
himself, as he retires.</i>) Awful old lady, that! I
quite thought she would know all about that letter,
or I should never have&mdash;&mdash; However, I said nothing
to compromise any one, luckily!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>entering</i>). Good morning, Rohesia.
So glad you felt equal to coming down. I was
almost afraid&mdash;after <em>last night</em>, you know.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>offering a cold cheekbone for salutation</i>).
I am in my usual health, thank you, Albinia. As
to last night, if you <em>must</em> ask a literary Socialist
down here, you might at least see that he is received
with common courtesy. You may, for anything <em>you</em>
can tell, have advanced the Social Revolution ten
years in a single evening!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> My <em>dear</em> Rohesia! If you remember,
it was you yourself who&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>closing her eyes</i>). I am in no condition
to <em>argue</em> about it, Albinia. The slightest exercise of
your own common sense would have shown you&mdash;&mdash; But
there, no great harm has been done, fortunately,
so let us say no more about it. I have something
more agreeable to talk about. I've every reason to
hope that Maisie and dear Gerald Thicknesse&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>astonished</i>). Maisie? But I thought
Gerald Thicknesse spoke as if&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Very possibly, my dear. I have
always refrained from giving him the slightest
encouragement, and I wouldn't put any pressure
upon dear Maisie for the world&mdash;still, I have my
feelings as a mother, and I can't deny that, with
such prospects as he has now, it <em>is</em> gratifying for
me to think that they may be coming to an understanding
together at this very moment. She is
showing him the grounds; which I always think
are the great charm of Wyvern, so <em>secluded</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). Together! At this very
moment! But&mdash;but surely Gerald has <em>gone</em>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Gone! What nonsense, Albinia!
Where in the world should he have gone to?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> He <em>was</em> leaving by the 10.40, I
know. For Aldershot. I ordered the cart for him,
and he said good-bye after breakfast. He seemed
so dreadfully down, poor fellow, and I quite concluded
from what he said that Maisie must have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Impossible, my dear, quite impossible!
I tell you he is <em>here</em>. Why, only a few
minutes ago, Mrs. Chatteris was telling me&mdash;&mdash; Ah,
here she is to speak for herself. (<i>To</i> Mrs. Chatteris,
<i>who appears, arrayed for divine service</i>.) Mrs.
Chatteris, did I, or did I <em>not</em>, understand you to say
just now that my daughter Maisie&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris</i> (<i>alarmed</i>). But, <em>dear</em> Lady Cantire,
I had no idea you would disapprove. Indeed you
seemed&mdash;&mdash; And really, though she certainly seems
to find him rather well&mdash;<em>sympathetic</em>&mdash;I'm sure&mdash;<em>almost</em>
sure&mdash;there can be nothing serious&mdash;at
present.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Thank you, my dear, I merely
wished for an answer to my question. And you see,
Albinia, that Gerald Thicknesse can hardly have
gone yet, since he is walking about the grounds with
Maisie.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> Captain Thicknesse? But he <em>has</em>
gone, Lady Cantire! I saw him start. I didn't
mean <em>him</em>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Indeed? then I shall be obliged
if you will say who it is you <em>did</em> mean.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Chatteris.</i> Why, only her old friend and
admirer&mdash;that little poet man, Mr. Blair.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>to herself</i>). And I actually <em>sent</em> him
to her! (<i>Rising in majestic wrath.</i>) Albinia, whatever
comes of this, remember I shall hold <em>you</em>
entirely responsible!</p>

<span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About</i> 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>softly</i>). And you really meant to go
away, and never let one of us know what had
happened to you!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). How easy it is after all
to be a hero! (<i>Aloud.</i>) That certainly <em>was</em> my intention,
only I was&mdash;er&mdash;not permitted to carry it out.
I trust you don't consider I should have been to blame?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>with shining eyes</i>). To <em>blame</em>? Mr.
Blair! As if I could possibly do that! (<i>To herself.</i>)
He doesn't even see <em>how</em> splendid it was of him!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I begin to believe that I
can do <em>no</em> wrong in her eyes! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It was not
altogether easy, believe me, to leave without even
having seen your face; but I felt so strongly that
it was better so.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>looking down</i>). And&mdash;do you still
feel that?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I must confess that I am well content
to have failed. It was such unspeakable torture to
think that you, Lady Maisie, <em>you</em> of all people, would
derive your sole idea of my personality from such
an irredeemable vulgarian as that veterinary surgeon&mdash;the
man Spurrell!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, with an almost imperceptible
start</i>). I suppose it's only natural he should
feel like that&mdash;but I wish&mdash;I <em>do</em> wish he had put it
just a little differently! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Poor Mr. Spurrell!
perhaps he was not exactly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Not <em>exactly</em>! I assure you it is
simply inconceivable to me that, in a circle of any
pretensions to culture and refinement, an ill-bred
boor like that could have been accepted for a
single moment as&mdash;I won't say a Man of <em>Genius</em>,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>the light dying out of her eyes</i>). No,
<em>don't</em>&mdash;don't go on, Mr. Blair. We were all excessively
stupid, no doubt, but you must make
allowances for us&mdash;for <em>me</em>, especially. I have had
so few opportunities of meeting people who are
really distinguished&mdash;in literature, at least. Most
of the people I know best are&mdash;well, not exactly
<em>clever</em>, you know. I so often wish I was in a set
that cared rather more about intellectual things!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with infinite pity</i>). How you must
have pined for freer air! How you must have starved
on such mental provender as, for example, the vapid
and inane commonplaces of that swaggering carpet-soldier,
Captain&mdash;Thickset, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>drawing back into her corner</i>). You
evidently don't know that Captain Thicknesse distinguished
himself greatly in the Soudan, where he
was very severely wounded.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Possibly; but that is scarcely to the
point. I do not question his efficiency as a fighting
animal. As to his intelligence, perhaps, the less
said the better.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>contracting her brows</i>). Decidedly. I
ought to have mentioned at once that Captain
Thicknesse is a very old friend of mine.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Really? <em>He</em>, at least, may be congratulated.
But pray don't think that I spoke with
any personal animus; I merely happen to entertain
a peculiar aversion for a class whose profession is
systematic slaughter. In these Democratic times,
when Humanity is advancing by leaps and bounds
towards International Solidarity, soldiers are such
grotesque and unnecessary anachronisms.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, with a little shiver</i>). Oh,
why does he&mdash;why <em>does</em> he? (<i>Aloud.</i>) I should
have thought that, until war itself is an anachronism,
men who are willing to fight and die for their country
could never be quite unnecessary. But we won't discuss
Captain Thicknesse, particularly now that he has
left Wyvern. Suppose we go back to Mr. Spurrell.
I know, of course, that, in leaving him in ignorance
as you did, you acted from the best and highest
motives; but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> It is refreshing to be so thoroughly
understood! I think I know what your "but still"
implies&mdash;why did I not foresee that he would infallibly
betray himself before long? I <em>did</em>. But I
gave him credit for being able to sustain his part for
another hour or two&mdash;until I had gone, in fact.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Then you didn't wish to spare <em>his</em>
feelings as well as ours?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> To be quite frank, I didn't trouble
myself about him: my sole object was to retreat
with dignity; he had got himself somehow or other
into a false position he must get out of as best he
could. After all, he would be none the worse for
having filled <em>my</em> place for a few hours.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>slowly</i>). I see. It didn't matter to
you whether he was suspected of being an impostor,
or made to feel uncomfortable, or&mdash;or anything.
Wasn't that a little unfeeling of you?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Unfeeling! I allowed him to keep
my evening clothes, which is more than a good
many&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> At all events, he may have had to
pay more heavily than you imagine. I wonder
whether&mdash;&mdash; But I suppose anything so unromantic
as the love affairs of a veterinary surgeon would
have no interest for you?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Why not, Lady Maisie? To the
Student of Humanity, and still more to the Poet,
the humblest love-story may have its interesting&mdash;even
its suggestive&mdash;aspect.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Well, I may tell you that it seems
Mr. Spurrell has long been attached, if not actually
engaged, to a maid of mine.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>startled out of his self-possession</i>). You&mdash;you
don't mean to Miss Phillipson?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> That <em>is</em> her name. How very odd
that you&mdash;&mdash; But perhaps Mr. Spurrell mentioned
it to you last night?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>recovering his sangfroid</i>). I am hardly
likely to have heard of it from any other quarter.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Of course not. And did he tell you
that she was here, in this very house?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> No, he never mentioned <em>that</em>. What
a remarkable coincidence!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Yes, rather. The worst of it is that
the foolish girl seems to have heard that he was a
guest here, and have jumped to the conclusion that
he had ceased to care for her; so she revenged
herself by a desperate flirtation with some worthless
wretch she met in the housekeeper's room, whose
flattery and admiration, I'm very much afraid, have
completely turned her head!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>uncomfortably</i>). Ah, well, she must
learn to forget him, and no doubt, in time&mdash;&mdash; How
wonderful the pale sunlight is on that yew
hedge!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You are not very sympathetic! I
should not have told you at all, only I wanted to
show you that if poor Mr. Spurrell <em>did</em> innocently
usurp your place, he may have lost&mdash;&mdash; But I see
all this only bores you.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Candidly, Lady Maisie, I can't affect
a very keen interest in the&mdash;er&mdash;gossip of the housekeeper's
room. Indeed, I am rather surprised that
<em>you</em> should condescend to listen to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). This is really <em>too</em> much!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) It never occurred to me that I was "condescending"
in taking an interest in a pretty and
wayward girl who happens to be my maid. But
then, I'm not a Democrat, Mr. Blair.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I&mdash;I'm afraid you construed my
remark as a rebuke; which it was not at all intended
to be.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> It would have been rather superfluous
if it had been, wouldn't it? (<i>Observing his
growing uneasiness.</i>) I'm afraid you don't find this
bench quite comfortable?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I&mdash;er&mdash;moderately so. (<i>To himself.</i>)
There's a female figure coming down the terrace
steps. It's horribly like&mdash;&mdash; But that must be
my morbid fancy; still, if I can get Lady Maisie
away, just in case&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) D&mdash;don't you think
sitting still becomes a little&mdash;er&mdash;monotonous after a
time? Couldn't we&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He rises, spasmodically.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>rising too</i>). Certainly; we have sat
here quite long enough. It is time we went back.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). We shall meet her! and
I'm almost sure it's&mdash;&mdash; I <em>must</em> prevent any&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Not <em>back</em>, Lady Maisie! You&mdash;you promised
to show me the orchid-house&mdash;you did, indeed!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Very well; we can go in, if you
care about orchids. It's on our way back.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This is too awful! It <em>is</em>
that girl Phillipson. She is looking for somebody!
Me! (<i>Aloud.</i>) On second thoughts, I don't think
I <em>do</em> care to see the orchids. I detest them; they
are such weird, unnatural, extravagant things. Let
us turn back and see if there are any snowdrops on
the lawn behind that hedge. I love the snowdrop,
it is so trustful and innocent, with its pure green-veined&mdash;&mdash; <em>Do</em>
come and search for snowdrops!</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Not just now. I think&mdash;(<i>as she
shields her eyes with one hand</i>)&mdash;I'm not quite sure
yet&mdash;but I rather fancy that must be my maid at
the other end of the walk.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). <em>I</em> assure you, Lady Maisie,
you are quite mistaken. Not the <em>least</em> like her!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, how can you
possibly tell that, without having seen her, Mr. Blair?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I&mdash;I meant&mdash;&mdash; You described her
as "pretty," you know. This girl is plain&mdash;distinctly
plain!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I don't agree at all. However, it
certainly is Phillipson, and she seems to have come
out in search of me; so I had better see if she has
any message.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> She hasn't. I'm <em>positive</em> she hasn't.
She&mdash;she wouldn't walk like <em>that</em> if she had. (<i>In
feverish anxiety.</i>) Lady Maisie, shall we turn back?
She&mdash;she hasn't seen us <em>yet</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Really, Mr. Blair! I don't quite
see why I should run away from my own maid!...
What is it, Phillipson?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She advances to meet</i> <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>leaving</i>

girl recognises me. I saw her face change!
She'll be jealous, I <em>know</em> she'll be jealous&mdash;and then
she'll tell Lady Maisie everything!... I wish to
Heaven I could hear what she is saying. Lady
Maisie seems agitated.... I&mdash;I might stroll gently

running away, perhaps. No, I'll stay here and face

worse holes than this since I came into this infernal

minutes alone, I <em>know</em> I can clear myself; it isn't as

<small>SHRINKAGE</small></h2>


<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Yew Walk.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself, as she watches</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>
<i>approaching</i>). How badly he walks, and what <em>does</em> he
mean by smiling at me like that? (<i>Aloud, coldly.</i>)
I am sorry, Mr. Blair, but I must leave you to finish
your stroll alone; my maid has just told me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>vehemently</i>). Lady Maisie, I ask you,
in common fairness, not to judge me until you
have heard <em>my</em> version. You will not allow the fact
that I travelled down here in the same compartment
with your maid, Phillipson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>wide-eyed</i>). The <em>same</em>! But <em>we</em>
came by that train. I thought you missed it?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I&mdash;I was not so fortunate. It is rather
a long and complicated story, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I'm afraid I really can't listen to you
<em>now</em>, Mr. Blair, after what I have heard from Phillipson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I implore you not to go without hearing
both sides. Sit down again&mdash;if only for a minute.
I feel confident that I can explain everything satisfactorily.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>sitting down</i>). I can't imagine what
there is to explain&mdash;and really I ought, if Phillipson&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> You know what maids <em>are</em>, Lady
Maisie. They embroider. Unintentionally, I dare
say, but still, they <em>do</em> embroider.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). She is very clever at mending
lace, I know, though what <em>that</em> has to do with it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Listen to me, Lady Maisie. I came
to this house at your bidding. Yes, but for your
written appeal, I should have treated the invitation
I received from your aunt with silent contempt.
Had I obeyed my first impulse and ignored it, I
should have been spared humiliations and indignities
which ought rather to excite your pity than&mdash;than
any other sensation. Think&mdash;try to realise what my
feelings must have been when I found myself expected
by the butler here to sit down to supper with
him and the upper servants in the housekeeper's room!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>shocked</i>). Oh, Mr. Blair! Indeed, I
had no&mdash;&mdash; You weren't <em>really</em>! How <em>could</em> they?
What <em>did</em> you say?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>haughtily</i>). I believe I let him know
my opinion of the snobbery of his employers in
treating a guest of theirs so cavalierly.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>distressed</i>). But surely&mdash;<em>surely</em> you
couldn't suppose that my uncle and aunt were
capable of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> What else <em>could</em> I suppose, under the
circumstances? It is true I have since learnt that I
was mistaken in this particular instance; but I
am not ignorant of the ingrained contempt you
aristocrats have for all who live by exercising their
intellect&mdash;the bitter scorn of birth for brains!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I am afraid the&mdash;the contempt is all
on the other side; but if <em>that</em> is how you feel about
it, I don't wonder that you were indignant.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Indignant! I was <em>furious</em>. In fact,
nothing would have induced me to sit down to supper
at all, if it hadn't been for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>in a small voice</i>). Then&mdash;you <em>did</em> sit
down? With the servants! Oh, Mr. Blair!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I thought you were already aware of
it. Yes, Lady Maisie, I endured even that. But
(<i>with magnanimity</i>) you must not distress yourself
about it now. If <em>I</em> can forget it, surely you can do
so!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Can I? That <em>you</em> should have
consented, for any consideration whatever; how
could you&mdash;how <em>could</em> you?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She admires me all the
more for it. But I <em>knew</em> she would take the right
view! (<i>Aloud, with pathos.</i>) I was only compelled
by absolute starvation. I had had an unusually light
lunch, and I was so hungry!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). That explains it, of
course.... I hope they gave you a good supper!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Excellent, thank you. Indeed, I was
astonished at the variety and even luxury of the
table. There was a pyramid of quails&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I am pleased to hear it. But I thought
there was something you were going to explain.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> I have been <em>endeavouring</em> to explain
to the best of my ability that if I have undesignedly
been the cause of&mdash;er&mdash;a temporary diversion in the
state of Miss Phillipson's affections, no one could
regret more deeply than I that the&mdash;er&mdash;ordinary
amenities of the supper-table should have been mistaken
for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>horrified</i>). Oh, stop, Mr. Blair, please
stop! I don't want to hear any more. I see now.
It was <em>you</em> who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Of course it was I. Surely the girl
herself has been telling you so just now!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You really thought <em>that</em> possible,
too? She simply came with a message from my
mother.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>slightly disconcerted</i>). Oh! If I had
known it was merely <em>that</em>. However, I am sure I
need not ask you to treat my&mdash;my communication in
the strictest confidence, Lady Maisie.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Indeed, that is <em>perfectly</em> unnecessary,
Mr. Blair.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Yes, I felt from the first that I could
trust you&mdash;even with my life. And I cannot regret
having told you, if it has enabled you to understand
me more thoroughly. It is such a relief that you
know all, and that there are no more secrets between
us. You <em>do</em> feel that I only acted as was natural
and inevitable under the circumstances?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh yes, yes. I&mdash;I dare say you
could not help it. I mean you did quite, <em>quite</em>
right!</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Ah, how you comfort me with your
fresh girlish&mdash;&mdash; You are not <em>going</em>, Lady Maisie?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>rising</i>). I must. I ought to have
gone before. My mother wants me. No, you are
not to come too; you can go on and gather those
snowdrops, you know.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She walks slowly back to the house.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>looking after her</i>). She took it wonderfully
well. I've made it all right, or she wouldn't
have said that about the snowdrops. Yes, she shall
not be disappointed; she shall have her posy!</p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>In the Morning-room. Half an hour later.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>alone&mdash;to herself</i>). Thank goodness,
<em>that's</em> over! It was <em>awful</em>. I don't think I <em>ever</em>
saw mamma a deeper shade of plum colour! <em>How</em>
I have been mistaken in Mr. Blair! That he could
write those lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Aspiring unto that far-off Ideal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may not stoop to any meaner love,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and yet philander with my poor foolish Phillipson
the moment he met her! And then to tell mamma
about my letter like that! Why, even Mr. Spurrell
had more discretion&mdash;to be sure, <em>he</em> knew nothing
about it&mdash;but <em>that</em> makes no difference! Rhoda was
right; I ought to have allowed a margin&mdash;only I
should never have allowed margin <em>enough</em>! The
worst of it is that, if mamma was unjust in some
things she said, she was right about <em>one</em>. I <em>have</em>
disgusted Gerald. He mayn't be brilliant, but at
least he's straightforward and loyal and a gentleman,
and&mdash;and he <em>did</em> like me once. He doesn't any
more&mdash;or he wouldn't have gone away. And it may
be ages before I ever get a chance to let him see
how <em>dreadfully</em> sorry&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She turns, and sees</i> Captain
<span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>.) Oh, haven't you gone <em>yet</em>?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Yes, I went, but I've come
back again. I&mdash;I couldn't help it; 'pon my word
I couldn't.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>with a sudden flush</i>). You&mdash;you
weren't <em>sent</em> for&mdash;by&mdash;by any one?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> So <em>likely</em> any one would send
for me, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I don't know why I said that; it
was silly, of course. But how&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Ran it a bit too fine; got to
Shuntin'bridge just in time to see the tail end of
the train disappearin'; wasn't another for hours&mdash;not
much to do <em>there</em>, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You might have taken a walk&mdash;or
gone to church.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> So I might, didn't occur to
me; and besides, I&mdash;I remembered I never said
good-bye to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Didn't you? And whose fault was
that?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Not mine, anyhow. You were
somewhere about the grounds with Mr. Blair.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Now you mention it, I believe I
was. We had&mdash;rather an interesting conversation.
Still, you might have come to look for me!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Perhaps you wouldn't have
been over and above glad to see me.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Oh yes, I should!&mdash;When it was
to say <em>good-bye</em>, you know!</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Ah! Well, I suppose I shall
only be in the way if I stop here any longer now.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Do you? What makes you suppose
that?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Nothin'! Saw your friend
the bard hurryin' along the terrace with a bunch
of snowdrops; he'll be here in another&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>in unmistakable horror</i>). Gerald,
<em>why</em> didn't you tell me before? There's only just
time!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She flies to a door and opens it.</i></p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> But I <em>say</em>, you know! Maisie,
may I come too?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Don't be a <em>goose</em>, Gerald. Of course
you can, if you like.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She disappears in the conservatory.</i></p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Can't quite make
this out, but I'm no end glad I came back!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He follows quickly.</i></p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>entering</i>). I hoped I should find her
here. (<i>He looks round.</i>) Her mother's gone&mdash;that's
<em>something</em>! I dare say Lady Maisie will come in
presently. (<i>He sits down and re-arranges his snowdrops.</i>)
It will be sweet to see her face light up

closer link between us! (<i>He hears the sound of
drapery behind him.</i>) Ah, already! (<i>Rising, and
presenting his flowers with downcast eyes.</i>) I&mdash;I
have ventured to gather these&mdash;for you. (<i>He raises
his eyes.</i>) Miss Spelwane!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>concealing his disappointment</i>). Oh&mdash;er&mdash;yes.
If you will give me the pleasure of accepting
them.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> I feel immensely proud. I was
so afraid you must have thought I was rather cross
to you last night. I didn't mean to be. I was
feeling a little overdone, that was all. But you have
chosen a charming way of letting me see that I am
forgiven. (<i>To herself.</i>) It's really <em>too</em> touching.
He certainly is a great improvement on the other
wretch!</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>dolefully</i>). I&mdash;I had no such intention,
I assure you. (<i>To himself.</i>) I hope to goodness
Lady Maisie won't come in before I can get rid of
this girl. I seem fated to be misunderstood here!</p>

<small>THE HAPPY DISPATCH</small></h2>


<p class="center">
"Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love, but&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang"><i>In the Morning-room.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About</i> 1 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself alone</i>). I'm rather sorry that
that Miss Spelwane couldn't stay. She's a trifle
angular&mdash;but clever. It was distinctly sharp of her
to see through that fellow Spurrell from the first,
and lay such an ingenious little trap for him. And
she has a great feeling for Literature&mdash;knows my
verses by heart, I discovered, quite accidentally. All
the same, I wish she hadn't intercepted those snowdrops.
Now I shall have to go out and pick some
more. (<i>Sounds outside in the entrance hall.</i>) Too
late&mdash;they've got back from church!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brooke-Chatteris</i> (<i>entering with</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>,
Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bearpark</span>). Such a nice, plain,
simple service&mdash;I'm positively <i>ravenous</i>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Struck me some of those chubby
choir-boys wanted smackin'. What a business it
seems to get the servants properly into their pew&mdash;as
bad as boxin' a string of hunters! As for <em>you</em>,
Archie, the way you fidgeted durin' the sermon was
downright disgraceful!... So <em>there</em> you are, Mr.
Blair; not been to church; but I forgot&mdash;p'raps you're
a Dissenter, or somethin'?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Only, Lady Rhoda, in the
sense that I have hitherto failed to discover any form
of creed that commands my intellectual assent.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>unimpressed</i>). I expect you haven't
tried. Are you a&mdash;what d'ye call it?&mdash;a Lacedemoniac?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>with lofty tolerance</i>). I <em>presume</em> you
mean a "Laodicean." No, I should rather describe
myself as a Deist.</p>

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>in a surly undertone</i>). What's a <i>Deast</i>
when he's at home? If he'd said a <em>Beast</em>, now!
(<i>Aloud, as</i> <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span> <i>enters with</i> Captain <span class="smcap">Thicknesse</span>.)
Hullo, why, here's Thicknesse! So you <em>haven't</em> gone,
after all, then?</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> What an observant young
beggar you are, Bearpark! Nothin' escapes you.
No, I haven't. (<i>To</i> Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, <i>rather sheepishly</i>.)
Fact, is, sir, I&mdash;I somehow just missed the train,
and&mdash;and&mdash;thought I might as well come back,
instead of waitin' about, don't you know.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>heartily</i>). Why, of course, my dear
boy, of course! Never have forgiven you if you
<em>hadn't</em>. Great nuisance for <em>you</em>, though. Hope you
blew the fool of a man up; he <em>ought</em> to have been
round in plenty of time.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse.</i> Not the groom's fault, sir. I
kept him waitin' a bit, and&mdash;and we had to stop to
shift the seat and that, and so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Great blundering booby!
Can't he see nobody wants him <em>here</em>? As if he hadn't
bored poor Lady Maisie enough at breakfast! Ah, well,
I must come to her rescue once more, I suppose!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Half an hour to lunch! Anybody like
to come round to the stables? I'm going to see how
my wife's horse Deerfoot is getting on. Fond of horses,
eh, Mr.&mdash;a&mdash;Undershell? Care to come with us?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I've seen quite enough of
<em>that</em> beast already! (<i>Aloud, with some asperity.</i>)
You must really excuse me, Sir Rupert. I am at
one with Mr. Ruskin&mdash;I <em>detest</em> horses.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Ah? Pity. We're rather fond of 'em
here. But we can't expect a poet to be a sportsman, eh?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> For my own poor part, I confess I
look forward to a day, not far distant, when the
spread of civilisation will have abolished every form
of so-called Sport.</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> <em>Do</em> you, though? (<i>After conquering
a choke with difficulty.</i>) Allow me to hope that you
will continue to enjoy the pleasures of anticipation
as long as possible. (<i>To the rest.</i>) Well, are you
coming?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>All except</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>follow their host out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>alone, to himself</i>). If they think I'm
going to be <em>patronised</em>, or suppress my honest convictions&mdash;&mdash;!
Now I'll go and pick those&mdash;&mdash;
(Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie</span> <i>enters from the conservatory</i>.) Ah,
Lady Maisie, I have been trying to find you. I had
plucked a few snowdrops, which I promised myself
the pleasure of presenting to you. Unfortunately
they&mdash;er&mdash;failed to reach their destination.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>distantly</i>). Thanks, Mr. Blair; I am
only sorry you should have given yourself such
unnecessary trouble.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>detaining her, as she seemed about to
pass on</i>). I have another piece of intelligence which
you may hear less&mdash;er&mdash;philosophically, Lady Maisie.
Your <i>bête noire</i> has returned.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>with lifted eyebrows</i>). My <i>bête noire</i>,
Mr. Blair?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Why affect not to understand? I
have an infallible instinct in all matters concerning
<em>you</em>, and, sweetly tolerant as you are, I instantly
divined what an insufferable nuisance you found our
military friend, Captain Thicknesse.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> There are limits even to <em>my</em> tolerance,
Mr. Blair. I admit I find some people insufferable&mdash;but
Captain Thicknesse is not one of them.</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> Then appearances are deceptive indeed.
Come, Lady Maisie, surely you can trust <em>me</em>!</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[Lady <span class="smcap">Cantire</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>in her most awful tones</i>). Maisie, my
dear, I appear to have interrupted an interview of a
somewhat confidential character. If so, pray let me
know it, and I will go elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>calmly</i>). Not in the very least,
mamma. Mr. Blair was merely trying to prepare
me for the fact that Captain Thicknesse has come
back; which was quite needless, as I happen to have
heard it already from his own lips.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Captain Thicknesse come back!
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Undershell</span>.) I wish to speak to my daughter.
May I ask you to leave us?</p>

<p><i>Undershell.</i> With pleasure, Lady Cantire. (<i>To
himself, as he retires.</i>) What a consummate actress
that girl is! And what a coquette!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>after a silence</i>). Maisie, what does
all this mean? No <em>nonsense</em>, now! What brought
Gerald Thicknesse back?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I <em>suppose</em> the dog-cart, mamma. He
missed his train, you know. I don't think he minds&mdash;much.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Let me tell you <em>this</em>, my dear. It
is a great deal more than you <em>deserve</em> after&mdash;&mdash; How
long has he come back for?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Only a few hours; but&mdash;but from
things he said, I fancy he would stay on longer&mdash;if
Aunt Albinia asked him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> Then we may consider that settled;
he stays. (Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> <i>appears</i>.) Here <em>is</em> your
aunt. You had better leave us, my dear.</p>


<blockquote><p class="hang space-above"><i>Somewhat later; the Party have assembled for Lunch.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Rupert</i> (<i>to his wife</i>). Well, my dear, I've seen
that young Spurrell (smart fellow he is, too, thoroughly
up in his business), and you'll be glad to hear he
can't find anything seriously wrong with Deerfoot.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>in the background, to himself</i>). No
more could I, for that matter!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> He's clear it isn't navicular, which
Adams was afraid of, and he thinks, with care and
rest, you know, the horse will be as fit as a fiddle in
a very few days.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Just exactly what I <em>told</em>
them; but the fools wouldn't believe <em>me</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Oh, Rupert, I <em>am</em> so glad. How
clever of that nice Mr. Spurrell! I was afraid my
poor Deerfoot would have to be shot.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She may thank me that
he <em>wasn't</em>. And this other fellow gets all the credit
for it. How like Life!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> And, Uncle Rupert, how about&mdash;about
Phillipson, you know? Is it all right?</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Phillipson? Oh, why, 'pon my word,
my dear, didn't think of asking.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> But <em>I</em> did, Maisie. And they met
this mornin', and it's all settled, and they're as happy
as they can be. Except that he's on the look out
for a mysterious stranger, who disappeared last
night, after tryin' to make desperate love to her.
He is determined, if he can find him, to give him a
piece of his mind.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<span class="smcap">Undershell</span> <i>endeavours to conceal his extreme
uneasiness</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner.</i> And the whole of a horsewhip. He
invited my opinion of it as an implement of castigation.
Kind of thing, you know, that would impart
"proficiency in the <i>trois temps</i>, as danced in the most
select circles," in a single lesson to a lame bear. (<i>To
himself.</i>) I drew my little bow at a venture, and
I'm hanged if it hasn't touched him up! There's
<em>something</em> fishy about this chap&mdash;I felt it all along.
Still, I don't see what more I can do&mdash;or I'd do it,
for poor old Gerry Thicknesse's sake.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I don't stir a step out of
this house while I'm here, that's all!</p>

<p><i>Sir Rupert.</i> Ha-ha! Athletic young chap that.
Glad to see him in the field next Tuesday. By the
way, Albinia, you've heard how Thicknesse here
contrived to miss his train this morning? Our gain,
of course; but still we must manage to get you back
to Aldershot to-night, my boy, or you'll get called
over the coals by your colonel when you <em>do</em> put in
an appearance, hey? Now, let's see; what train
ought you to catch?</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>He takes up</i> "Bradshaw" <i>from a writing-table</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>possessing herself of the volume</i>).
Allow me, Rupert, my eyes are better than yours.
<em>I</em> will look out his trains for him. (<i>After consulting
various pages.</i>) Just as I <em>thought</em>! Quite impossible
for him to reach North Camp to-night now. There
isn't a train till six, and <em>that</em> gets to town just too
late for him to drive across to Waterloo and catch
the last Aldershot train. So there's no more to be
said.</p>

<p class="rdir hang">[<i>She puts</i> "Bradshaw" <i>away</i>.</p>

<p><i>Captain Thicknesse</i> (<i>with undisguised relief</i>). Oh,
well, dessay they won't kick up much of a row if I
don't get back till to-morrow,&mdash;or the day <em>after</em>, if it
comes to that.</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It <em>shan't</em> come to that&mdash;if
<em>I</em> can prevent it! Lady Maisie is quite in despair, I
can see. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Indeed? I was&mdash;a&mdash;not aware
that discipline was quite so lax as that in the

up the dates, don't you know. Mean to say, got it
into my head to-day was the 20th, instead of only
the 18th. (<i>Lamely.</i>) That's how it <em>was</em>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Delightful, my dear Gerald. Then
we shall keep you here till Tuesday, of <em>course</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>raising her glasses</i>). Upon my word,
Mr. Blair! If you will kindly leave Captain
Thicknesse to make his own arrangements&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>interposing hastily</i>). But, mamma,
you must have misunderstood Mr. Blair! As if he
would <em>dream</em> of&mdash;&mdash; He was merely mentioning
the train he wishes to go by himself. <em>Weren't</em> you,
Mr. Blair?</p>

<p><i>Undershell</i> (<i>blinking and gasping</i>). I&mdash;eh? Just
so, that&mdash;that <em>was</em> my intention, certainly. (<i>To
himself.</i>) Does she at all realise what this will
cost her?</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> My dear Mr. Blair, I&mdash;I'd no
notion we were to lose you so soon; but if you're
really quite <em>sure</em> you must go&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Really, Albinia, we must
give him credit for knowing his own mind. He tells
you he is <em>obliged to go</em>!</p>

<p><i>Lady Culverin.</i> Then of course we must let you
do <em>exactly</em> as you please.</p>

<p><i>Pilliner</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Lady Maisie's a little brick!
No notion she had it <em>in</em> her. No occasion to bother
myself about the beggar now. "Let him alone and
he'll go home, and carry his tail beneath him!"</p>

well. By the bye, see that some one packs Mr.

the dog-cart round after lunch in time to catch the

<p><i>Archie</i> (<i>sotto voce, to</i> <span class="smcap">Pilliner</span>). We don't want any

a decided impression. And there is at least one&mdash;perhaps
<em>two</em>&mdash;who will miss me when I am gone.</p>

<p class="center space-above">Volume 1 of the Series, Price 2s.</p>

<p class="center spaced">THE STORY OF BESSIE COSTRELL,<br />

By Mrs. HUMPHRY WARD.</p>

<blockquote><p>The CHRISTIAN WORLD.&mdash;"Mrs. Ward has done nothing finer than this brief story.
The sustained interest, which does not permit the reader to miss a line; the vivid clearness
in which each character stands out in self-revelation; the unfailing insight into the familiar
and confused workings of the village mind&mdash;all represent work of the highest class. 'The
Story of Bessie Costrell' will become an English classic."</p>

<p>The TIMES.&mdash;"There are masterly touches and striking sentences in many pages of
this little volume.... Mrs. Humphry Ward's admirers will say that she has seldom
written with more force than in describing the tardy remorse of the hard, unrelenting
husband."</p>

<p>The MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.&mdash;"As full of power as anything Mrs. Ward has written,
and the impetus of its style, together with the charm belonging to many of its turns of
thought, as well as of phrase, would of themselves suffice to hold any reader who takes it
up until he has turned its last page."</p>

<p>The DAILY TELEGRAPH.&mdash;"An admirable example of Mrs. Humphry Ward's literary
power; a brief, decided, and masterful sketch."</p></blockquote>


<p class="center space-above">Volume 2 of the Series, Price 3s.</p>

<p class="center spaced">THE TALKING HORSE;<br />

AND OTHER TALES.</p>

<p>From THE SATURDAY REVIEW.&mdash;"A capital set of stories, thoroughly clever
and witty, often pathetic, and always humorous."</p>

<p>From THE ATHENÆUM.&mdash;"The grimmest of mortals, in his most surly mood,
could hardly resist the fun of 'The Talking Horse.'"</p>

<p class="center spaced">THE GIANT'S ROBE.</p>

<p>From THE PALL MALL GAZETTE.&mdash;"The main interest of the book, which is
very strong indeed, begins when Vincent returns, when Harold Caffyn discovers the secret,
when every page threatens to bring down doom on the head of the miserable Mark. Will
he confess? Will he drown himself? Will Vincent denounce him? Will Caffyn inform
on him? Will his wife abandon him?&mdash;we ask eagerly as we read and cannot cease
reading till the puzzle is solved in a series of exciting situations."</p>

<i>CHEAP EDITION</i>, Crown 8vo, limp red cloth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="center spaced">THE PARIAH.</p>

<p>From THE SATURDAY REVIEW.&mdash;"In 'The Pariah' we are more than ever
struck by the sharp intuitive perception and the satirical balancing of judgment which
makes the author's writings such extremely entertaining reading. There is not a dull
page&mdash;we might say, not a dull sentence&mdash;in it.... The girls are delightfully drawn,
especially the bewitching Margot and the childish Lettice. Nothing that polish and finish,
cleverness, humour, wit, and sarcasm can give is left out."</p>

<p class="center spaced">VICE VERSÂ;<br />

OR, A LESSON TO FATHERS.</p>

<p>From THE SATURDAY REVIEW.&mdash;"If ever there was a book made up from
beginning to end of laughter, and yet not a comic book, or a 'merry' book, or a book of
jokes, or a book of pictures, or a jest book, or a tomfool book, but a perfectly sober and
serious book, in the reading of which a sober man may laugh without shame from
beginning to end, it is the book called 'Vice Versâ; or, a Lesson to Fathers.'... We
close the book, recommending it very earnestly to all fathers in the first instance, and
their sons, nephews, uncles, and male cousins next."</p>


<p class="center space-above"><i>CHEAP EDITION</i>, Crown 8vo, limp red cloth, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="center spaced">A FALLEN IDOL.</p>

<p>From THE TIMES.&mdash;"Mr. Anstey's new story will delight the multitudinous public
that laughed over 'Vice Versâ'.... The boy who brings the accursed image to
Champion's house, Mr. Bales, the artist's factotum, and above all Mr. Yarker, the ex-butler
who has turned policeman, are figures whom it is as pleasant to meet as it is impossible
to forget."</p>
